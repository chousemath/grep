s1/s1_e1.txt:6:Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
s1/s1_e1.txt:7:Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
s1/s1_e1.txt:11:Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
s1/s1_e1.txt:23:Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!
s1/s1_e1.txt:24:Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
s1/s1_e1.txt:35:Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:36:Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:37:Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky!
s1/s1_e1.txt:40:Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
s1/s1_e1.txt:42:Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
s1/s1_e1.txt:49:Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
s1/s1_e1.txt:50:Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
s1/s1_e1.txt:52:Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:53:Monica: Rachel?!
s1/s1_e1.txt:54:Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
s1/s1_e1.txt:57:Rachel: Hi, sure!
s1/s1_e1.txt:61:Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
s1/s1_e1.txt:65:Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
s1/s1_e1.txt:67:Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
s1/s1_e1.txt:72:Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
s1/s1_e1.txt:74:Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
s1/s1_e1.txt:78:Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
s1/s1_e1.txt:83:Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
s1/s1_e1.txt:86:Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
s1/s1_e1.txt:91:Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!
s1/s1_e1.txt:96:Monica: Yes!
s1/s1_e1.txt:99:Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
s1/s1_e1.txt:103:Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
s1/s1_e1.txt:106:Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
s1/s1_e1.txt:107:All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
s1/s1_e1.txt:111:Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
s1/s1_e1.txt:114:Joey:  Hey, Paul!
s1/s1_e1.txt:117:Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!
s1/s1_e1.txt:119:Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
s1/s1_e1.txt:128:Phoebe: (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
s1/s1_e1.txt:139:Joey: Done with the bookcase!
s1/s1_e1.txt:140:Chandler: All finished!
s1/s1_e1.txt:148:Chandler: Oh my God!
s1/s1_e1.txt:150:Monica: Oh my God!
s1/s1_e1.txt:155:Paul: (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
s1/s1_e1.txt:156:Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
s1/s1_e1.txt:161:Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
s1/s1_e1.txt:162:Joey: Shut up!
s1/s1_e1.txt:163:Chandler: You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:165:Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
s1/s1_e1.txt:167:Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
s1/s1_e1.txt:169:Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
s1/s1_e1.txt:181:Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
s1/s1_e1.txt:186:Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
s1/s1_e1.txt:189:Joey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
s1/s1_e1.txt:209:Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so much!
s1/s1_e1.txt:210:Monica: Stop!
s1/s1_e1.txt:214:Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
s1/s1_e1.txt:216:All: Okayyy! (They do so.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:221:Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
s1/s1_e1.txt:235:Monica: Big time!
s1/s1_e1.txt:238:Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!
s1/s1_e1.txt:243:Frannie: Hey, Monica!
s1/s1_e1.txt:244:Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
s1/s1_e1.txt:247:Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?
s1/s1_e1.txt:253:Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
s1/s1_e1.txt:254:Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:256:Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!
s1/s1_e1.txt:261:Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
s1/s1_e1.txt:265:Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
s1/s1_e1.txt:267:Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
s1/s1_e1.txt:269:Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
s1/s1_e1.txt:284:Rachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
s1/s1_e1.txt:285:Monica: You can, I know you can!
s1/s1_e1.txt:287:Ross: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:291:Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!
s1/s1_e1.txt:295:Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
s1/s1_e1.txt:313:Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
s1/s1_e1.txt:331:All: Yes!
s1/s1_e10.txt:6:All: Oooh!
s1/s1_e10.txt:10:Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
s1/s1_e10.txt:12:Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
s1/s1_e10.txt:13:Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
s1/s1_e10.txt:30:Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
s1/s1_e10.txt:31:Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
s1/s1_e10.txt:33:Phoebe: Yeah, you wish!
s1/s1_e10.txt:37:All: Woooo! Yeah!
s1/s1_e10.txt:40:Rachel: (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
s1/s1_e10.txt:57:Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
s1/s1_e10.txt:59:Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
s1/s1_e10.txt:60:Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
s1/s1_e10.txt:69:Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
s1/s1_e10.txt:72:Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
s1/s1_e10.txt:76:Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
s1/s1_e10.txt:77:Rachel: Yeah!
s1/s1_e10.txt:82:Monica: What?!
s1/s1_e10.txt:83:Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
s1/s1_e10.txt:85:Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
s1/s1_e10.txt:86:Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
s1/s1_e10.txt:90:Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
s1/s1_e10.txt:92:Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
s1/s1_e10.txt:94:Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
s1/s1_e10.txt:99:Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
s1/s1_e10.txt:109:Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
s1/s1_e10.txt:127:Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
s1/s1_e10.txt:150:Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
s1/s1_e10.txt:163:David: Hey!
s1/s1_e10.txt:165:David: Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
s1/s1_e10.txt:166:Phoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!
s1/s1_e10.txt:169:Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)
s1/s1_e10.txt:185:Phoebe: Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
s1/s1_e10.txt:188:Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)
s1/s1_e10.txt:194:Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.
s1/s1_e10.txt:197:Ross: Par-tay!
s1/s1_e10.txt:205:Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
s1/s1_e10.txt:208:Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
s1/s1_e10.txt:216:Janice: (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
s1/s1_e10.txt:217:Chandler: (Imitating) But you found me!
s1/s1_e10.txt:218:Janice: Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
s1/s1_e10.txt:221:Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
s1/s1_e10.txt:223:Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
s1/s1_e10.txt:224:Joey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
s1/s1_e10.txt:229:Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
s1/s1_e10.txt:236:Phoebe: Hi, Max!
s1/s1_e10.txt:247:Phoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
s1/s1_e10.txt:260:Rachel: The bll is drrbing!
s1/s1_e10.txt:265:Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
s1/s1_e10.txt:273:Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
s1/s1_e11.txt:17:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e11.txt:18:Phoebe: Do it!
s1/s1_e11.txt:19:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e11.txt:20:Phoebe: Do it do it do it!
s1/s1_e11.txt:21:Monica: (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
s1/s1_e11.txt:23:Phoebe: I can't believe you did that!
s1/s1_e11.txt:27:Phoebe: I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
s1/s1_e11.txt:32:Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
s1/s1_e11.txt:33:Phoebe: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
s1/s1_e11.txt:41:Rachel: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
s1/s1_e11.txt:46:Joey: C'mon, she's your mom!
s1/s1_e11.txt:47:Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
s1/s1_e11.txt:48:Rachel: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
s1/s1_e11.txt:59:Phoebe: Hey hey hey! She's on!
s1/s1_e11.txt:60:Paolo: Ah! Nora Bing!
s1/s1_e11.txt:68:Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
s1/s1_e11.txt:71:All: Awww!
s1/s1_e11.txt:74:Mrs. Bing: (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
s1/s1_e11.txt:82:Phoebe: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
s1/s1_e11.txt:87:Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
s1/s1_e11.txt:98:Rachel: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
s1/s1_e11.txt:103:Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
s1/s1_e11.txt:104:Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
s1/s1_e11.txt:123:Mrs. Bing: No, it's you!
s1/s1_e11.txt:141:Joey: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
s1/s1_e11.txt:143:Joey: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
s1/s1_e11.txt:162:Ross: Well, not playing raquetball!
s1/s1_e11.txt:163:Joey: He forgot to leave his grip size!
s1/s1_e11.txt:164:Ross: He didn't get the goggles!
s1/s1_e11.txt:177:Joey: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
s1/s1_e11.txt:185:Phoebe: No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
s1/s1_e11.txt:187:Phoebe: Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
s1/s1_e11.txt:197:Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
s1/s1_e11.txt:200:Chandler: (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
s1/s1_e11.txt:208:Joey: What are you mad at me for?!
s1/s1_e11.txt:210:Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
s1/s1_e11.txt:211:Joey: (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
s1/s1_e11.txt:213:Joey: Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
s1/s1_e11.txt:229:Rachel: Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
s1/s1_e11.txt:232:Joey: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
s1/s1_e11.txt:239:(She sees Monica sneaking out) Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break! (Runs out, knocking over the mike stand)
s1/s1_e11.txt:240:Rachel: (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
s1/s1_e11.txt:249:Chandler: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
s1/s1_e11.txt:253:Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
s1/s1_e11.txt:255:Ross: Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
s1/s1_e11.txt:259:Monica: Oh! You're awake!
s1/s1_e11.txt:260:Phoebe: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
s1/s1_e11.txt:262:Monica: You look good!
s1/s1_e11.txt:263:Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
s1/s1_e11.txt:273:Phoebe: I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
s1/s1_e11.txt:284:Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
s1/s1_e11.txt:290:Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
s1/s1_e11.txt:300:Ross: Wow!
s1/s1_e11.txt:305:Joey: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
s1/s1_e11.txt:307:Joey: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
s1/s1_e11.txt:324:Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.
s1/s1_e11.txt:332:Ross: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
s1/s1_e11.txt:333:Rachel: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
s1/s1_e11.txt:334:All: Nooo!
s1/s1_e12.txt:8:Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
s1/s1_e12.txt:11:Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
s1/s1_e12.txt:17:Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!
s1/s1_e12.txt:18:Ross: (waves) Hello!
s1/s1_e12.txt:27:Phoebe: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
s1/s1_e12.txt:31:Chandler: (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
s1/s1_e12.txt:36:Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
s1/s1_e12.txt:39:Chandler: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
s1/s1_e12.txt:44:Carol: Hey hey, come on in!
s1/s1_e12.txt:46:Ross: Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
s1/s1_e12.txt:47:Carol: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
s1/s1_e12.txt:51:Carol: Totally and completely healthy!
s1/s1_e12.txt:52:Ross: Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)
s1/s1_e12.txt:59:Ross: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:61:Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...
s1/s1_e12.txt:63:Susan: Oh, hello Ross!
s1/s1_e12.txt:66:Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
s1/s1_e12.txt:69:Ross: (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
s1/s1_e12.txt:83:Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
s1/s1_e12.txt:98:Joey: Aw, I know all about Kip!
s1/s1_e12.txt:106:Paolo: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
s1/s1_e12.txt:109:Phoebe: Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
s1/s1_e12.txt:113:Phoebe: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
s1/s1_e12.txt:117:Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
s1/s1_e12.txt:120:Ross: Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
s1/s1_e12.txt:121:Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
s1/s1_e12.txt:124:Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!
s1/s1_e12.txt:125:Ross: Hi Pheebs!
s1/s1_e12.txt:126:Rachel: Pheebs!
s1/s1_e12.txt:127:Phoebe: Fine!
s1/s1_e12.txt:131:Rachel: Oh, right, that's me!
s1/s1_e12.txt:139:Joey: Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
s1/s1_e12.txt:140:Chandler: More coffee over here, please!
s1/s1_e12.txt:146:Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:158:Monica: Oh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:159:Ross: The actress!
s1/s1_e12.txt:164:Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
s1/s1_e12.txt:166:Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
s1/s1_e12.txt:170:Joey: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)
s1/s1_e12.txt:171:Chandler: That's patio furniture!
s1/s1_e12.txt:172:Joey: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
s1/s1_e12.txt:177:Chandler: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
s1/s1_e12.txt:178:Joey: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
s1/s1_e12.txt:179:Chandler: Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
s1/s1_e12.txt:181:Phoebe: Hey!
s1/s1_e12.txt:182:Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
s1/s1_e12.txt:187:Phoebe: Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,
s1/s1_e12.txt:190:Rachel: (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
s1/s1_e12.txt:200:Chandler: I know!
s1/s1_e12.txt:203:Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
s1/s1_e12.txt:204:Monica: Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
s1/s1_e12.txt:209:Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
s1/s1_e12.txt:210:Rachel: No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
s1/s1_e12.txt:211:Phoebe: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
s1/s1_e12.txt:213:Rachel: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
s1/s1_e12.txt:214:Rachel and Phoebe: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
s1/s1_e12.txt:216:Rachel: I don't know...right, he's the pig!
s1/s1_e12.txt:217:Phoebe: Such a pig!
s1/s1_e12.txt:222:Rachel: ...pig...pig man!
s1/s1_e12.txt:223:Phoebe: Yes, good! Ok...
s1/s1_e12.txt:225:Phoebe: (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
s1/s1_e12.txt:234:Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
s1/s1_e12.txt:235:Ross: (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
s1/s1_e12.txt:238:Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
s1/s1_e12.txt:240:Joey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
s1/s1_e12.txt:241:Chandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
s1/s1_e12.txt:246:Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
s1/s1_e12.txt:247:Phoebe: Ooh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:268:Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great!
s1/s1_e12.txt:275:Phoebe: Yep!
s1/s1_e12.txt:284:Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
s1/s1_e12.txt:285:Girls: Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
s1/s1_e12.txt:286:Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
s1/s1_e12.txt:291:Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
s1/s1_e12.txt:292:Joey: Hey!
s1/s1_e12.txt:293:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e12.txt:294:Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! (they hug)
s1/s1_e12.txt:299:Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
s1/s1_e12.txt:300:Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms.)
s1/s1_e12.txt:301:Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
s1/s1_e12.txt:302:Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
s1/s1_e12.txt:303:Chandler: Yeah, get out!
s1/s1_e12.txt:304:Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
s1/s1_e12.txt:306:Joey: Oh yeah!
s1/s1_e13.txt:4:Rachel: That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
s1/s1_e13.txt:5:Chandler: I'm sorry!
s1/s1_e13.txt:6:Rachel: You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
s1/s1_e13.txt:8:Rachel: No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
s1/s1_e13.txt:10:Rachel: What? What?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:12:Rachel: Oh!!
s1/s1_e13.txt:18:Phoebe: Oops!
s1/s1_e13.txt:23:Rachel: He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
s1/s1_e13.txt:41:Roger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
s1/s1_e13.txt:45:Roger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
s1/s1_e13.txt:50:All: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
s1/s1_e13.txt:59:Mr. Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
s1/s1_e13.txt:68:Joey: Since then?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:77:Joey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!
s1/s1_e13.txt:102:Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
s1/s1_e13.txt:103:Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
s1/s1_e13.txt:106:Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
s1/s1_e13.txt:107:Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
s1/s1_e13.txt:109:Rachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
s1/s1_e13.txt:117:Monica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
s1/s1_e13.txt:125:Ronni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
s1/s1_e13.txt:131:Ronni: That's a good one!
s1/s1_e13.txt:137:Mr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
s1/s1_e13.txt:159:Mr. Tribbiani: I can't do that!
s1/s1_e13.txt:160:Joey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
s1/s1_e13.txt:162:Joey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
s1/s1_e13.txt:172:Chandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
s1/s1_e13.txt:176:Chandler: Get off!
s1/s1_e13.txt:196:Joey: (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:197:Rachel: I thought it was Chandler!
s1/s1_e13.txt:199:Rachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
s1/s1_e13.txt:205:Phoebe: Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
s1/s1_e13.txt:218:Joey: Ma! What're you doing here?
s1/s1_e13.txt:220:Joey: Oww! Big ring!
s1/s1_e13.txt:221:Mrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and it folds away)
s1/s1_e13.txt:223:Mrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
s1/s1_e13.txt:224:Joey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:225:Mrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
s1/s1_e13.txt:226:Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:247:Phoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
s1/s1_e13.txt:248:Roger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
s1/s1_e13.txt:264:All: Aaawwwwww!!
s1/s1_e13.txt:266:Phoebe: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
s1/s1_e13.txt:271:Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:276:Mr. Tribbiani: Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)
s1/s1_e14.txt:9:Joey: You're in!
s1/s1_e14.txt:27:Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
s1/s1_e14.txt:28:Phoebe: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
s1/s1_e14.txt:35:Joey: Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
s1/s1_e14.txt:37:Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
s1/s1_e14.txt:50:Joey: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
s1/s1_e14.txt:51:Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
s1/s1_e14.txt:53:Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
s1/s1_e14.txt:58:Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
s1/s1_e14.txt:59:Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
s1/s1_e14.txt:63:Phoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
s1/s1_e14.txt:94:Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!
s1/s1_e14.txt:100:Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
s1/s1_e14.txt:104:Janice: Happy Valentine's Day!
s1/s1_e14.txt:107:Chandler: No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:108:Janice: Kiss me!
s1/s1_e14.txt:112:Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:115:Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
s1/s1_e14.txt:117:Rachel: Oh my god. Janice, hi!
s1/s1_e14.txt:138:Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
s1/s1_e14.txt:142:Phoebe: Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
s1/s1_e14.txt:151:Rachel and Phoebe: Eww!
s1/s1_e14.txt:162:Janice: Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
s1/s1_e14.txt:174:Ross: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
s1/s1_e14.txt:177:Fireman No. 2: A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
s1/s1_e14.txt:198:Chandler: Call me!
s1/s1_e14.txt:221:Phoebe: See, there you go, the cleansing works!
s1/s1_e14.txt:226:Fireman No. 2: No way!
s1/s1_e14.txt:227:Fireman No. 3: Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
s1/s1_e15.txt:12:Rachel: Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I'm sorry!
s1/s1_e15.txt:20:Phoebe: Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
s1/s1_e15.txt:22:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e15.txt:23:All: Hey!
s1/s1_e15.txt:28:All: That's great!
s1/s1_e15.txt:31:Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
s1/s1_e15.txt:42:Phoebe: Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
s1/s1_e15.txt:44:Phoebe: Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
s1/s1_e15.txt:46:Phoebe: (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
s1/s1_e15.txt:49:Monica: (excited) Oh my God!
s1/s1_e15.txt:50:Phoebe: Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
s1/s1_e15.txt:52:Phoebe: OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
s1/s1_e15.txt:60:Rachel: I don't!
s1/s1_e15.txt:64:Monica: Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
s1/s1_e15.txt:65:Phoebe: Ooh! Brian's Song!
s1/s1_e15.txt:67:Monica: So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
s1/s1_e15.txt:73:Monica: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
s1/s1_e15.txt:74:Phoebe: Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)
s1/s1_e15.txt:87:Joey: I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
s1/s1_e15.txt:89:Ross: Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
s1/s1_e15.txt:90:Celia: I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
s1/s1_e15.txt:100:Rachel: My God! What happened to you?
s1/s1_e15.txt:102:Phoebe: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
s1/s1_e15.txt:104:Rachel: (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
s1/s1_e15.txt:110:Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
s1/s1_e15.txt:115:Monica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
s1/s1_e15.txt:118:Rachel: Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
s1/s1_e15.txt:134:Joey: (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
s1/s1_e15.txt:135:Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
s1/s1_e15.txt:138:Joey: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
s1/s1_e15.txt:144:Joey: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
s1/s1_e15.txt:148:Joey: Come on! You like this woman, right?
s1/s1_e15.txt:152:Joey: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
s1/s1_e15.txt:156:Joey: There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
s1/s1_e15.txt:162:Joey: Say it... say it!
s1/s1_e15.txt:166:Ross: (rushing to explain) Funny story!
s1/s1_e15.txt:167:Joey: You're not going to believe this!
s1/s1_e15.txt:172:Chandler: (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
s1/s1_e15.txt:175:Phoebe: (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
s1/s1_e15.txt:176:Chandler: Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
s1/s1_e15.txt:177:Phoebe: Oh! You have a window!
s1/s1_e15.txt:178:Chandler: Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
s1/s1_e15.txt:179:Phoebe: Oh look! That guy's peeing!
s1/s1_e15.txt:182:Chandler: This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
s1/s1_e15.txt:188:Monica: (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
s1/s1_e15.txt:199:Rachel: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
s1/s1_e15.txt:200:Monica: Hi Steve!
s1/s1_e15.txt:204:Phoebe: (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.
s1/s1_e15.txt:215:Rachel: Let me, let me get you some wine!
s1/s1_e15.txt:217:Steve: Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
s1/s1_e15.txt:218:Monica: I'm so glad you liked them!
s1/s1_e15.txt:219:Steve: Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
s1/s1_e15.txt:225:Steve: (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
s1/s1_e15.txt:227:Steve: (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
s1/s1_e15.txt:229:Steve: Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
s1/s1_e15.txt:237:Steve: Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!  I'm drowning!   Help!"
s1/s1_e15.txt:238:Monica: (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
s1/s1_e15.txt:244:Steve: (excited) Hey!
s1/s1_e15.txt:246:Joey: What a tool!
s1/s1_e15.txt:248:Ross: Yeah!
s1/s1_e15.txt:251:Phoebe: Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
s1/s1_e15.txt:255:Joey: All right, Ross!
s1/s1_e15.txt:257:Joey: Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
s1/s1_e15.txt:265:Chandler: (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
s1/s1_e15.txt:268:Steve: Eeeee!
s1/s1_e15.txt:270:Steve: Aaaaah!
s1/s1_e15.txt:274:Steve: Aaaaahhh!!
s1/s1_e15.txt:275:Phoebe: There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
s1/s1_e16.txt:9:Chandler: It’s Phoebe! Hi!
s1/s1_e16.txt:12:Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
s1/s1_e16.txt:18:Chandler and Joey: No, no, no!
s1/s1_e16.txt:28:Chandler: They’re twins!
s1/s1_e16.txt:29:Joey: I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!
s1/s1_e16.txt:35:All: Hey guys! Hey!
s1/s1_e16.txt:37:Phoebe: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
s1/s1_e16.txt:41:Phoebe: The woman who cuts my hair!
s1/s1_e16.txt:80:Ross: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.
s1/s1_e16.txt:116:Joey: She is so hot!
s1/s1_e16.txt:144:Ross: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
s1/s1_e16.txt:172:Phoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
s1/s1_e16.txt:234:Phoebe: That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!
s1/s1_e16.txt:241:Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
s1/s1_e16.txt:253:Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
s1/s1_e16.txt:279:Rachel: (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!
s1/s1_e16.txt:303:Nina: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!
s1/s1_e16.txt:342:Rachel: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)
s1/s1_e16.txt:344:Monica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
s1/s1_e16.txt:346:Rachel: (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
s1/s1_e17.txt:30:Rachel: Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
s1/s1_e17.txt:44:Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!
s1/s1_e17.txt:60:Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:86:Rachel: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
s1/s1_e17.txt:89:The Whole Party: (Jumping up) SURPRISE!!!
s1/s1_e17.txt:105:Phoebe's Friends: (Finally noticing the guest of honour) Surprise!
s1/s1_e17.txt:106:Phoebe: (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?
s1/s1_e17.txt:111:Mr. Geller: I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
s1/s1_e17.txt:126:Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay, coming!
s1/s1_e17.txt:139:Rachel (as Monica): You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... (They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT!
s1/s1_e17.txt:143:Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
s1/s1_e17.txt:153:Rachel: (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
s1/s1_e17.txt:158:Monica: What!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:160:Monica: (getting angry) What!!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:163:Rachel: Hello! Here we go!
s1/s1_e17.txt:165:Rachel: (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
s1/s1_e17.txt:176:Monica: (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
s1/s1_e17.txt:181:Monica: (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
s1/s1_e17.txt:191:Rachel: (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing "You are...") ...dead!
s1/s1_e17.txt:202:Monica: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
s1/s1_e17.txt:207:Rachel: Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
s1/s1_e17.txt:213:Ross and Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e17.txt:224:Ursula: Oh!
s1/s1_e17.txt:233:Ursula: Oh, wow! You remembered! (Opening it) Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
s1/s1_e17.txt:262:Ursula: You have not changed!
s1/s1_e17.txt:291:Ross: You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
s1/s1_e17.txt:300:Nurse: Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
s1/s1_e17.txt:301:Ross: Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
s1/s1_e17.txt:324:Phoebe: (as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
s1/s1_e17.txt:326:Phoebe: (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
s1/s1_e17.txt:332:Phoebe: (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
s1/s1_e17.txt:340:(Phoebe smiles, when Joey takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Joey gets up to leave but stops suddenly. Phoebe silently shouts "Oh, whoa!!" to herself, and leans back in the sofa to recover, a hand to her tingling lips. A thoughtful Joey is also feeling his lips, so he hesitates for a moment, then returns for a better view, he thinks again, cocking his head from side to side to regard her profile from various angles, then...)
s1/s1_e17.txt:356:Monica: Oh, look, he's waking up!
s1/s1_e17.txt:357:Ross: (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?
s1/s1_e17.txt:358:(All of a sudden, Marcel grabs Ross's finger with his whole fist, and he squeezes it, so tight, that Ross finally knows what it is to be a father. He looks up at his friends, who smile encouragingly, Rachel tenderly resting her chin upon Monica's shoulder. Ross realises that Chandler was right and he's gonna make a great dad!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:361:Ross: Aqui est�. (Here it is!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:363:Chandler: �Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:365:Rachel: �Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look, Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:367:All:�Ewww! (Ewww!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:369:All: �Hola, Joey! (Hi, Joey!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:370:Joey: �Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:373:Ross: �Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)
s1/s1_e18.txt:11:Rachel: (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
s1/s1_e18.txt:19:Rachel: (to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica): OK, read them to me.
s1/s1_e18.txt:23:Phoebe: Wow!
s1/s1_e18.txt:25:Phoebe: (reading): Your Visa bill is huge!
s1/s1_e18.txt:26:Rachel: (grabs the bill) Give me that!
s1/s1_e18.txt:28:Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
s1/s1_e18.txt:37:Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!
s1/s1_e18.txt:38:Rachel: Hi! How are you?
s1/s1_e18.txt:42:Joey: Shut up!
s1/s1_e18.txt:58:Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
s1/s1_e18.txt:68:Rachel: Oh, good for you!
s1/s1_e18.txt:69:Phoebe: Congratulations!
s1/s1_e18.txt:74:Rachel: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)
s1/s1_e18.txt:80:Phoebe and Rachel: OOooooo!
s1/s1_e18.txt:88:Monica: (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
s1/s1_e18.txt:93:Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
s1/s1_e18.txt:95:Guys: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
s1/s1_e18.txt:102:Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!
s1/s1_e18.txt:116:Chandler: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
s1/s1_e18.txt:121:Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
s1/s1_e18.txt:123:Ross: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
s1/s1_e18.txt:131:Monica: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
s1/s1_e18.txt:133:Monica: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
s1/s1_e18.txt:134:Rachel: Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
s1/s1_e18.txt:135:Monica: You're kidding! Where? Where?
s1/s1_e18.txt:137:Monica: Oh, Rachel!
s1/s1_e18.txt:140:Rachel: Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
s1/s1_e18.txt:142:Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
s1/s1_e18.txt:149:Rachel: Oh my God!
s1/s1_e18.txt:151:Aunt Iris: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice earrings.
s1/s1_e18.txt:162:Rachel: Hi!
s1/s1_e18.txt:164:Rachel: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
s1/s1_e18.txt:166:Rachel: Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
s1/s1_e18.txt:167:All: That's great! That's wonderful!
s1/s1_e18.txt:205:Phoebe: (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
s1/s1_e18.txt:211:Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
s1/s1_e18.txt:218:Rachel: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
s1/s1_e18.txt:226:Monica: (slams down cards) I hate this game!
s1/s1_e18.txt:239:Rachel: No..!
s1/s1_e18.txt:240:Ross: Show them to me!
s1/s1_e18.txt:241:Rachel: Get your hands out of there! No!
s1/s1_e18.txt:242:Ross: Let me see! Show them!
s1/s1_e18.txt:254:Rachel: Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
s1/s1_e18.txt:273:Rachel: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
s1/s1_e18.txt:290:Phoebe: ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
s1/s1_e18.txt:308:Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!
s1/s1_e18.txt:313:Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
s1/s1_e18.txt:317:Joey: Oh!
s1/s1_e18.txt:320:Phoebe: That's a bird!
s1/s1_e18.txt:325:Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!
s1/s1_e18.txt:327:Joey: (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
s1/s1_e18.txt:328:Rachel: Yes!
s1/s1_e19.txt:9:Rachel: Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
s1/s1_e19.txt:10:Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
s1/s1_e19.txt:13:Rachel: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
s1/s1_e19.txt:17:Rachel: Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
s1/s1_e19.txt:23:Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
s1/s1_e19.txt:26:Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
s1/s1_e19.txt:27:Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
s1/s1_e19.txt:30:Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
s1/s1_e19.txt:33:Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
s1/s1_e19.txt:35:Monica: Wonderful!
s1/s1_e19.txt:36:Phoebe: So good!
s1/s1_e19.txt:41:Monica: There was nudity!
s1/s1_e19.txt:43:Monica and Phoebe: Hugh! Hugh Grant!
s1/s1_e19.txt:44:Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
s1/s1_e19.txt:46:Rachel: (To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
s1/s1_e19.txt:63:Rachel: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)
s1/s1_e19.txt:83:Rachel: Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
s1/s1_e19.txt:93:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e19.txt:103:Rachel: Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
s1/s1_e19.txt:120:Rachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:122:Rachel: See? I've even called Animal Control!
s1/s1_e19.txt:127:Ross: That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
s1/s1_e19.txt:131:Rachel: Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
s1/s1_e19.txt:134:Ross: Cat!
s1/s1_e19.txt:135:Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
s1/s1_e19.txt:144:Phoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!
s1/s1_e19.txt:145:Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
s1/s1_e19.txt:146:Luisa: Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
s1/s1_e19.txt:147:Rachel: Yeah!
s1/s1_e19.txt:148:Luisa: Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
s1/s1_e19.txt:149:Rachel: Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
s1/s1_e19.txt:150:Monica: The Luisa from home room!
s1/s1_e19.txt:151:Rachel: Yes!!
s1/s1_e19.txt:156:Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
s1/s1_e19.txt:157:Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!
s1/s1_e19.txt:158:Rachel: What?!
s1/s1_e19.txt:161:Phoebe: Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
s1/s1_e19.txt:174:Joey: Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
s1/s1_e19.txt:181:Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
s1/s1_e19.txt:183:Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
s1/s1_e19.txt:188:Chandler: Marcel?!
s1/s1_e19.txt:194:Phoebe: Oh-my-God!
s1/s1_e19.txt:195:Monica: Whaaat!
s1/s1_e19.txt:196:Phoebe: Something just brushed up against my right leg!
s1/s1_e19.txt:200:Monica: Look, Phoebe!
s1/s1_e19.txt:201:Phoebe: Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
s1/s1_e19.txt:203:Luisa: Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)
s1/s1_e19.txt:207:Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
s1/s1_e19.txt:208:Phoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.
s1/s1_e19.txt:213:Ross: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
s1/s1_e19.txt:215:Ross: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
s1/s1_e19.txt:216:Rachel: Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
s1/s1_e19.txt:217:Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
s1/s1_e19.txt:224:Rachel: Ross!
s1/s1_e19.txt:227:Both: Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
s1/s1_e19.txt:240:Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?
s1/s1_e19.txt:246:Luisa: (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.
s1/s1_e19.txt:252:Luisa: No!
s1/s1_e19.txt:253:Rachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
s1/s1_e19.txt:256:Rachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
s1/s1_e19.txt:269:Rachel: Barry?!
s1/s1_e19.txt:271:Ross and Rachel: Oh!
s1/s1_e19.txt:272:Ross: We have got to start locking that door!
s1/s1_e19.txt:283:Phoebe: Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
s1/s1_e2.txt:5:Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
s1/s1_e2.txt:6:Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
s1/s1_e2.txt:19:Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
s1/s1_e2.txt:24:Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
s1/s1_e2.txt:37:Ross: Pregnant?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:40:Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
s1/s1_e2.txt:43:Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:46:Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
s1/s1_e2.txt:49:Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
s1/s1_e2.txt:52:Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
s1/s1_e2.txt:54:Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
s1/s1_e2.txt:55:All: Eeaagh!
s1/s1_e2.txt:60:Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that!
s1/s1_e2.txt:61:Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
s1/s1_e2.txt:62:Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
s1/s1_e2.txt:63:Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
s1/s1_e2.txt:65:Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
s1/s1_e2.txt:72:Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
s1/s1_e2.txt:73:Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
s1/s1_e2.txt:81:Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
s1/s1_e2.txt:87:Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.
s1/s1_e2.txt:96:Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?
s1/s1_e2.txt:98:Mrs. Geller: Mmmm!
s1/s1_e2.txt:99:Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
s1/s1_e2.txt:109:Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
s1/s1_e2.txt:113:Mr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
s1/s1_e2.txt:116:Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.
s1/s1_e2.txt:118:Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
s1/s1_e2.txt:124:Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
s1/s1_e2.txt:126:Mrs. Geller: (To Monica) And you knew about this?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:146:Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
s1/s1_e2.txt:153:Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
s1/s1_e2.txt:159:Ross: Yes, yes!
s1/s1_e2.txt:160:Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
s1/s1_e2.txt:183:Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
s1/s1_e2.txt:184:Robbie: Huh?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:186:Rachel: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
s1/s1_e2.txt:198:Ross: Marlon?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:214:Robbie: Me?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:215:Barry: No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.
s1/s1_e2.txt:216:Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:218:Rachel: Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!
s1/s1_e2.txt:219:Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
s1/s1_e2.txt:220:Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
s1/s1_e2.txt:231:Robbie: Hello?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:233:Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
s1/s1_e2.txt:236:Ross: Thank you!
s1/s1_e2.txt:243:Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
s1/s1_e2.txt:244:Carol: All right, you two, stop it!
s1/s1_e2.txt:248:Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
s1/s1_e2.txt:249:Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
s1/s1_e2.txt:250:Dr. Oberman: (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
s1/s1_e2.txt:265:Phoebe: Okay!
s1/s1_e2.txt:271:Monica: Am not!
s1/s1_e2.txt:273:Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
s1/s1_e20.txt:5:Joey: No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
s1/s1_e20.txt:7:Monica: (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
s1/s1_e20.txt:8:Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
s1/s1_e20.txt:11:Phoebe: How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
s1/s1_e20.txt:14:Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
s1/s1_e20.txt:16:Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
s1/s1_e20.txt:19:Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
s1/s1_e20.txt:25:Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
s1/s1_e20.txt:29:Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
s1/s1_e20.txt:30:Ross: What? What? What?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:31:Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
s1/s1_e20.txt:33:All: Oh!... Right!
s1/s1_e20.txt:34:Chandler: Hey Rach!
s1/s1_e20.txt:40:Rachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
s1/s1_e20.txt:41:Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
s1/s1_e20.txt:44:Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
s1/s1_e20.txt:46:Chandler: Yes!
s1/s1_e20.txt:50:Rachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
s1/s1_e20.txt:52:Rachel: Wow... Wow!
s1/s1_e20.txt:58:Chandler: (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
s1/s1_e20.txt:59:Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:60:Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
s1/s1_e20.txt:63:Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
s1/s1_e20.txt:64:Phoebe: Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!
s1/s1_e20.txt:66:Joey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
s1/s1_e20.txt:84:Rachel: Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
s1/s1_e20.txt:85:Barry: We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
s1/s1_e20.txt:93:Rachel: What?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:100:Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
s1/s1_e20.txt:112:All: Hey! Hi!
s1/s1_e20.txt:119:Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
s1/s1_e20.txt:123:Rachel: I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
s1/s1_e20.txt:124:Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
s1/s1_e20.txt:128:Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
s1/s1_e20.txt:134:Rachel: (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
s1/s1_e20.txt:136:Rachel: Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
s1/s1_e20.txt:139:Monica: Brrrrrrr!
s1/s1_e20.txt:142:Joey: (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
s1/s1_e20.txt:144:Joey: (ducking) Get down!
s1/s1_e20.txt:146:Chandler: ...And boogie!
s1/s1_e20.txt:149:Rachel: Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
s1/s1_e20.txt:151:Rachel: And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
s1/s1_e20.txt:152:Joey: ..Naughty!
s1/s1_e20.txt:160:Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
s1/s1_e20.txt:162:Chandler: No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
s1/s1_e20.txt:174:Rachel: Of course!
s1/s1_e20.txt:175:Mindy: Oh that's so great!
s1/s1_e20.txt:177:Mindy: That's all!
s1/s1_e20.txt:178:Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
s1/s1_e20.txt:180:Rachel: Oh sure it is!
s1/s1_e20.txt:181:Mindy: Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
s1/s1_e20.txt:185:Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
s1/s1_e20.txt:200:Chandler: Ring dammit, ring!
s1/s1_e20.txt:203:Chandler: What?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:205:Chandler: (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
s1/s1_e20.txt:206:Monica: Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
s1/s1_e20.txt:207:Joey: Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
s1/s1_e20.txt:208:Chandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!
s1/s1_e20.txt:215:Monica: So she's a woman! So what?
s1/s1_e20.txt:216:Joey: Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
s1/s1_e20.txt:217:Monica: Joey!!
s1/s1_e20.txt:221:Monica: (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
s1/s1_e20.txt:230:Barry: I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
s1/s1_e20.txt:235:Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
s1/s1_e20.txt:243:Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
s1/s1_e20.txt:245:Rachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
s1/s1_e20.txt:254:Rachel: Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
s1/s1_e20.txt:264:Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
s1/s1_e20.txt:275:Phoebe: Whoo-hoo!
s1/s1_e20.txt:276:Monica: Yeah, there you go!
s1/s1_e20.txt:277:Ross: Second date!
s1/s1_e20.txt:279:Rachel: You don't know?!
s1/s1_e21.txt:5:Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
s1/s1_e21.txt:11:Phoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
s1/s1_e21.txt:12:Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
s1/s1_e21.txt:13:Rachel: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
s1/s1_e21.txt:18:Rachel: (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
s1/s1_e21.txt:26:Monica: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
s1/s1_e21.txt:28:Monica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
s1/s1_e21.txt:34:Monica: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
s1/s1_e21.txt:46:(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)
s1/s1_e21.txt:47:Joey: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
s1/s1_e21.txt:48:Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
s1/s1_e21.txt:57:Rachel: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
s1/s1_e21.txt:58:Phoebe: This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
s1/s1_e21.txt:71:Teacher: (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
s1/s1_e21.txt:76:Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
s1/s1_e21.txt:77:Phoebe: (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
s1/s1_e21.txt:92:Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
s1/s1_e21.txt:95:Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)
s1/s1_e21.txt:105:Joey: (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
s1/s1_e21.txt:111:Joey: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
s1/s1_e21.txt:117:Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
s1/s1_e21.txt:126:Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
s1/s1_e21.txt:129:Chandler: ...Take off their hats!
s1/s1_e21.txt:130:Phoebe: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
s1/s1_e21.txt:134:Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
s1/s1_e21.txt:136:Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
s1/s1_e21.txt:137:Rachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
s1/s1_e21.txt:148:Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
s1/s1_e21.txt:153:Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
s1/s1_e21.txt:157:Joey: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
s1/s1_e21.txt:178:Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
s1/s1_e21.txt:181:Monica: Yo- hooo!
s1/s1_e21.txt:184:Rachel: Are you drunk?!
s1/s1_e21.txt:185:Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
s1/s1_e21.txt:188:Rachel: Monica? Monica!
s1/s1_e21.txt:189:Monica: Water rules!
s1/s1_e21.txt:192:Rachel: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
s1/s1_e21.txt:193:Monica: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
s1/s1_e21.txt:208:Monica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
s1/s1_e21.txt:215:Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
s1/s1_e21.txt:221:Teacher: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
s1/s1_e21.txt:222:Monica: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
s1/s1_e21.txt:227:Phoebe: Oh!
s1/s1_e21.txt:236:Ross: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
s1/s1_e22.txt:8:Rachel: Shut up!
s1/s1_e22.txt:14:Chandler: Wow!
s1/s1_e22.txt:59:Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
s1/s1_e22.txt:76:Chandler: Ah!
s1/s1_e22.txt:95:Rachel: A-ha!
s1/s1_e22.txt:112:Chandler: What?!
s1/s1_e22.txt:134:Chandler: That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
s1/s1_e22.txt:160:Young Ethan: Wow!
s1/s1_e22.txt:169:Young Ethan: Huh!
s1/s1_e22.txt:201:Ross: Huh!
s1/s1_e22.txt:211:All: (shouting) Mon!
s1/s1_e22.txt:226:Ross: It's morphin time!
s1/s1_e22.txt:227:Joey: Stegosaurus!
s1/s1_e22.txt:228:Chandler: Tyrannosaurus!
s1/s1_e22.txt:230:Phoebe: Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!
s1/s1_e22.txt:247:Phoebe: You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
s1/s1_e22.txt:294:Rachel: (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
s1/s1_e22.txt:298:Rachel: You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!
s1/s1_e23.txt:50:Ross: I got it—I'm getting it!
s1/s1_e23.txt:56:Rachel: Oh, that's funny!
s1/s1_e23.txt:63:Joey: (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
s1/s1_e23.txt:73:Lydia: Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
s1/s1_e23.txt:74:Joey: Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
s1/s1_e23.txt:77:Lydia: Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
s1/s1_e23.txt:105:Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
s1/s1_e23.txt:133:Lydia: Isn't!
s1/s1_e23.txt:141:Carol: You're gonna kill me!
s1/s1_e23.txt:153:Ross: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
s1/s1_e23.txt:157:Susan: He started it!
s1/s1_e23.txt:159:Susan: You did!
s1/s1_e23.txt:162:Carol: Now go!
s1/s1_e23.txt:166:Carol: Out!
s1/s1_e23.txt:172:Joey: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
s1/s1_e23.txt:186:Phoebe: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
s1/s1_e23.txt:193:All: Help!
s1/s1_e23.txt:194:Ross: I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.
s1/s1_e23.txt:204:Joey: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was just—yeah, right. Push! Push!
s1/s1_e23.txt:207:Ross: Help! Help!
s1/s1_e23.txt:209:Susan and Ross: (even louder) Help!
s1/s1_e23.txt:215:Chandler: Mazel tov!
s1/s1_e23.txt:257:Carol: But they're not here yet!
s1/s1_e23.txt:262:Phoebe: (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
s1/s1_e23.txt:268:Ross: Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
s1/s1_e23.txt:270:Janitor: (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!
s1/s1_e23.txt:272:All: Push, push!
s1/s1_e23.txt:273:Ross: We're here!
s1/s1_e23.txt:277:Nurse: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
s1/s1_e23.txt:278:All: Good luck!
s1/s1_e23.txt:281:Nurse: Out!
s1/s1_e23.txt:284:Carol: (straining) Not.... helping!
s1/s1_e23.txt:286:Ross: (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.
s1/s1_e23.txt:288:Ross: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
s1/s1_e23.txt:293:Phoebe: (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!
s1/s1_e23.txt:294:Ross: Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
s1/s1_e24.txt:5:Monica: Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
s1/s1_e24.txt:6:Phoebe: Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
s1/s1_e24.txt:7:Rachel: Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
s1/s1_e24.txt:27:Phoebe: Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
s1/s1_e24.txt:35:Monica and Phoebe: Ewww!
s1/s1_e24.txt:56:Phoebe: Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
s1/s1_e24.txt:68:Phoebe: So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
s1/s1_e24.txt:73:Joey: Hey!
s1/s1_e24.txt:74:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e24.txt:80:Joey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
s1/s1_e24.txt:111:Rachel: (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
s1/s1_e24.txt:113:Rachel: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
s1/s1_e24.txt:114:Phoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
s1/s1_e24.txt:116:Melanie: There is a little child inside this man!
s1/s1_e24.txt:123:Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
s1/s1_e24.txt:143:Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
s1/s1_e24.txt:144:Rachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
s1/s1_e24.txt:147:Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!
s1/s1_e24.txt:152:Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
s1/s1_e24.txt:162:Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
s1/s1_e24.txt:165:Flight Attendant: Alright!
s1/s1_e24.txt:166:Ross: Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
s1/s1_e24.txt:168:Rachel: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
s1/s1_e24.txt:170:Flight Attendant: Hi!
s1/s1_e24.txt:176:Flight Attendant: No no no! Federal regulations!
s1/s1_e24.txt:184:Man: (to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
s1/s1_e24.txt:186:Melanie: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
s1/s1_e24.txt:188:Melanie: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)
s1/s1_e24.txt:191:Joey: Sure! Why not?
s1/s1_e24.txt:202:Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
s1/s1_e24.txt:211:Rachel: No!
s1/s1_e24.txt:217:Rachel: No! There is.. there is noone else!
s1/s1_e24.txt:218:Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
s1/s1_e24.txt:221:Joey: Shhhh!
s1/s1_e24.txt:227:Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
s1/s1_e24.txt:229:Joey: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
s1/s1_e24.txt:231:Joey: I know! Neither did I!
s1/s1_e24.txt:233:Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
s1/s1_e24.txt:241:Monica: (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
s1/s1_e24.txt:243:Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
s1/s1_e24.txt:250:Joey: Seven hundred bucks!
s1/s1_e24.txt:251:Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
s1/s1_e24.txt:256:Carl: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
s1/s1_e24.txt:266:Carl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
s1/s1_e24.txt:280:Carl: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
s1/s1_e24.txt:281:Rachel: Right! You're right!
s1/s1_e24.txt:285:Rachel: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
s1/s1_e24.txt:291:Man: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
s1/s1_e3.txt:4:Phoebe: (entering) Hi guys!
s1/s1_e3.txt:5:All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
s1/s1_e3.txt:7:Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
s1/s1_e3.txt:20:Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
s1/s1_e3.txt:25:Chandler: Hey, that was really good!
s1/s1_e3.txt:26:Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going.
s1/s1_e3.txt:33:Chandler: Relax your hand!
s1/s1_e3.txt:35:Chandler: Not so much!
s1/s1_e3.txt:36:Joey: Whoah!
s1/s1_e3.txt:37:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e3.txt:38:Joey: Hey!
s1/s1_e3.txt:51:Joey: That's ridiculous!
s1/s1_e3.txt:53:Rachel: (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
s1/s1_e3.txt:55:Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me!
s1/s1_e3.txt:65:Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!
s1/s1_e3.txt:67:Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
s1/s1_e3.txt:75:All: Oh! Oh, God!
s1/s1_e3.txt:76:Ross: What is this?!
s1/s1_e3.txt:78:Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
s1/s1_e3.txt:79:Chandler: And this- is my reward!
s1/s1_e3.txt:81:Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit!
s1/s1_e3.txt:82:All: Ohhh! Put it out!
s1/s1_e3.txt:83:Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:84:Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
s1/s1_e3.txt:90:All: Oh, come on! Come on!
s1/s1_e3.txt:92:Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
s1/s1_e3.txt:105:All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
s1/s1_e3.txt:108:Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
s1/s1_e3.txt:112:Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
s1/s1_e3.txt:117:Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
s1/s1_e3.txt:124:Alan: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
s1/s1_e3.txt:129:Monica: C'mon!
s1/s1_e3.txt:131:All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
s1/s1_e3.txt:132:Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
s1/s1_e3.txt:133:All: Yeah!
s1/s1_e3.txt:137:Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
s1/s1_e3.txt:143:Monica: Really!
s1/s1_e3.txt:153:All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
s1/s1_e3.txt:154:Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
s1/s1_e3.txt:191:Phoebe: Huh!
s1/s1_e3.txt:193:Ross: A thumb?!
s1/s1_e3.txt:195:All: Eww!
s1/s1_e3.txt:196:Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
s1/s1_e3.txt:199:All: Nooo!
s1/s1_e3.txt:201:All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
s1/s1_e3.txt:202:Rachel: It's worse than the thumb!
s1/s1_e3.txt:203:Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!
s1/s1_e3.txt:205:Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
s1/s1_e3.txt:223:Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
s1/s1_e3.txt:225:Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
s1/s1_e3.txt:234:Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:250:Ross: Hey, I might!
s1/s1_e3.txt:253:Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
s1/s1_e3.txt:258:Joey: Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:260:All: Oh! That was Lambchop!
s1/s1_e3.txt:264:Phoebe: There it is!
s1/s1_e3.txt:273:Joey: Okay!
s1/s1_e3.txt:274:Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
s1/s1_e3.txt:277:Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
s1/s1_e3.txt:278:Rachel: (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
s1/s1_e3.txt:280:All: Oh, yeah! Right!
s1/s1_e3.txt:302:All: No no no!
s1/s1_e3.txt:303:Chandler: (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
s1/s1_e3.txt:304:Phoebe: (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
s1/s1_e4.txt:5:Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
s1/s1_e4.txt:11:Joey: Probably kill myself!
s1/s1_e4.txt:13:Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
s1/s1_e4.txt:21:Phoebe: (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
s1/s1_e4.txt:24:Phoebe: I got no sleep last night!
s1/s1_e4.txt:26:Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
s1/s1_e4.txt:30:Joey: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
s1/s1_e4.txt:32:Joey: (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
s1/s1_e4.txt:33:Chandler: Happy birthday, pal!
s1/s1_e4.txt:45:Joey: The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
s1/s1_e4.txt:46:Chandler: (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
s1/s1_e4.txt:49:Joey: C'mon, Ross!
s1/s1_e4.txt:53:Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
s1/s1_e4.txt:63:All: Oh! Yeah!
s1/s1_e4.txt:65:Guys: Hockey! (They go to leave but are blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne.  The guys pause to stare at them.) Hockey! Hockey. (The guys.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:67:Rachel: Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.
s1/s1_e4.txt:70:Kiki: Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
s1/s1_e4.txt:72:Rachel: (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
s1/s1_e4.txt:73:Leslie: I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
s1/s1_e4.txt:77:Phoebe: (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:79:Chandler: ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:80:Joey: Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:92:Joey: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
s1/s1_e4.txt:94:Rachel: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
s1/s1_e4.txt:95:Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
s1/s1_e4.txt:101:Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
s1/s1_e4.txt:106:Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:111:Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
s1/s1_e4.txt:115:Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks!
s1/s1_e4.txt:117:Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
s1/s1_e4.txt:119:Rachel: Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
s1/s1_e4.txt:126:Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
s1/s1_e4.txt:132:Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
s1/s1_e4.txt:145:Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
s1/s1_e4.txt:147:Ross: Pass it! Pass it!
s1/s1_e4.txt:148:Chandler: He's open!
s1/s1_e4.txt:149:All: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
s1/s1_e4.txt:151:Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
s1/s1_e4.txt:167:Pizza Guy: (yelling from outside) Pizza guy!
s1/s1_e4.txt:175:Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
s1/s1_e4.txt:176:Monica: (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
s1/s1_e4.txt:177:Pizza Guy: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
s1/s1_e4.txt:185:Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:188:Monica: I see pizza!
s1/s1_e4.txt:189:Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:192:Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
s1/s1_e4.txt:197:Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:199:Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
s1/s1_e4.txt:205:Monica and Phoebe: Shut up!
s1/s1_e4.txt:223:Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
s1/s1_e4.txt:227:Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
s1/s1_e4.txt:228:Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
s1/s1_e4.txt:229:Monica: What?! You slept with Jason?
s1/s1_e4.txt:233:Monica: Oh, that's nice!
s1/s1_e4.txt:234:Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
s1/s1_e4.txt:235:Monica: Excuse me?!
s1/s1_e4.txt:237:Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
s1/s1_e4.txt:238:Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
s1/s1_e4.txt:239:Phoebe: There he is! There he is!
s1/s1_e4.txt:241:Phoebe: Right- where we've been looking all night!
s1/s1_e4.txt:242:Rachel: He is so cute!
s1/s1_e4.txt:243:Monica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
s1/s1_e4.txt:244:All: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the—(pause)—wowww.
s1/s1_e4.txt:253:Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
s1/s1_e4.txt:261:Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
s1/s1_e4.txt:262:Kid: No! No! (They start to fight over it.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:263:Receptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
s1/s1_e4.txt:264:Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
s1/s1_e4.txt:277:Rachel: Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
s1/s1_e4.txt:280:Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
s1/s1_e5.txt:7:Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
s1/s1_e5.txt:12:Ross: Multiple orgasms!
s1/s1_e5.txt:14:Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
s1/s1_e5.txt:75:Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
s1/s1_e5.txt:76:Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
s1/s1_e5.txt:203:Rachel: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
s1/s1_e5.txt:210:Monica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
s1/s1_e5.txt:218:Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh!
s1/s1_e5.txt:219:Joey: Ow!
s1/s1_e5.txt:230:Janice: Ow!
s1/s1_e5.txt:234:Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
s1/s1_e5.txt:257:Rachel: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
s1/s1_e5.txt:258:Woman: Let go!
s1/s1_e5.txt:260:Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
s1/s1_e5.txt:262:Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
s1/s1_e5.txt:263:Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
s1/s1_e5.txt:286:Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!
s1/s1_e6.txt:4:Rachel: (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
s1/s1_e6.txt:6:Phoebe: The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
s1/s1_e6.txt:23:Chandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
s1/s1_e6.txt:24:Ross: Oh. Hel-lo!
s1/s1_e6.txt:25:Chandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
s1/s1_e6.txt:26:Monica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
s1/s1_e6.txt:28:Rachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
s1/s1_e6.txt:33:Monica: You could do that!
s1/s1_e6.txt:35:All: Yeah!
s1/s1_e6.txt:37:Ross: C'mon! C'mon!
s1/s1_e6.txt:40:Chandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
s1/s1_e6.txt:45:All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
s1/s1_e6.txt:48:All: ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
s1/s1_e6.txt:51:Chandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:53:Joey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
s1/s1_e6.txt:54:Phoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
s1/s1_e6.txt:61:Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
s1/s1_e6.txt:81:All: What?!
s1/s1_e6.txt:87:Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
s1/s1_e6.txt:88:Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
s1/s1_e6.txt:90:Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
s1/s1_e6.txt:98:Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
s1/s1_e6.txt:99:All: Yeah! C'mon!
s1/s1_e6.txt:103:Rachel: Tah-daaah!
s1/s1_e6.txt:105:Rachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
s1/s1_e6.txt:108:All: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
s1/s1_e6.txt:109:Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
s1/s1_e6.txt:116:Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!
s1/s1_e6.txt:117:Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
s1/s1_e6.txt:118:Monica: That is so unfair!
s1/s1_e6.txt:119:Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
s1/s1_e6.txt:123:Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
s1/s1_e6.txt:126:Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
s1/s1_e6.txt:128:Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
s1/s1_e6.txt:131:Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
s1/s1_e6.txt:133:Joey: (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
s1/s1_e6.txt:134:All: Oh my God! Whoah!
s1/s1_e6.txt:136:Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
s1/s1_e6.txt:138:Joey: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
s1/s1_e6.txt:144:Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
s1/s1_e6.txt:146:Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
s1/s1_e6.txt:154:Joey: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
s1/s1_e6.txt:156:Joey: Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:159:Monica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
s1/s1_e6.txt:160:Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
s1/s1_e6.txt:172:Director: (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?
s1/s1_e6.txt:199:Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
s1/s1_e6.txt:208:Aurora: You have me!
s1/s1_e6.txt:215:Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
s1/s1_e6.txt:227:All: Hey!
s1/s1_e6.txt:234:All: Oh!
s1/s1_e6.txt:235:Joey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
s1/s1_e6.txt:239:Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
s1/s1_e6.txt:243:Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
s1/s1_e6.txt:244:Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:249:Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!
s1/s1_e6.txt:255:Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
s1/s1_e7.txt:11:Rachel: Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
s1/s1_e7.txt:21:Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
s1/s1_e7.txt:25:Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
s1/s1_e7.txt:33:Rachel: That had to hurt!
s1/s1_e7.txt:35:Chandler: Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
s1/s1_e7.txt:37:Chandler: There you go!
s1/s1_e7.txt:45:Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
s1/s1_e7.txt:48:Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
s1/s1_e7.txt:53:Joey: (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
s1/s1_e7.txt:58:All: Whoooaa!
s1/s1_e7.txt:61:Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
s1/s1_e7.txt:66:All: No way!
s1/s1_e7.txt:70:Monica: You did not go!
s1/s1_e7.txt:74:Joey: We have a winner!
s1/s1_e7.txt:104:Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
s1/s1_e7.txt:106:Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)
s1/s1_e7.txt:107:Ross: Shhhh!
s1/s1_e7.txt:110:Rachel: Ahhhh!
s1/s1_e7.txt:140:Monica: Oh my God! I love him!
s1/s1_e7.txt:143:Monica: My surprise party!
s1/s1_e7.txt:150:Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
s1/s1_e7.txt:156:Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
s1/s1_e7.txt:158:Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
s1/s1_e7.txt:159:Ross: What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
s1/s1_e7.txt:168:Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
s1/s1_e7.txt:182:Phoebe: (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
s1/s1_e7.txt:192:Monica: (smitten) Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:194:Monica: Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:196:Monica: Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:199:Paolo: (pointing at game) Monopoly!
s1/s1_e7.txt:200:Rachel: Look at that!
s1/s1_e7.txt:204:Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
s1/s1_e7.txt:209:Phoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
s1/s1_e7.txt:212:Phoebe: (smiling) You betcha!
s1/s1_e7.txt:217:Chandler: Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
s1/s1_e7.txt:221:Jill: My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?
s1/s1_e7.txt:231:Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
s1/s1_e7.txt:240:Paolo: Ross!
s1/s1_e7.txt:249:Paolo: Oh!
s1/s1_e7.txt:250:Ross: Yeah! Se vice?
s1/s1_e7.txt:256:Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
s1/s1_e7.txt:259:Jill: Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
s1/s1_e7.txt:270:Joey: (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
s1/s1_e8.txt:14:Shelley: Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...
s1/s1_e8.txt:26:Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
s1/s1_e8.txt:32:All: Yeah! Right!
s1/s1_e8.txt:33:Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
s1/s1_e8.txt:38:Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
s1/s1_e8.txt:39:Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
s1/s1_e8.txt:55:Monica: Oh God!
s1/s1_e8.txt:59:Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
s1/s1_e8.txt:70:Monica: Ross!
s1/s1_e8.txt:72:Mrs. Geller: What is going on?!
s1/s1_e8.txt:82:Nurse: This almost never happens!
s1/s1_e8.txt:93:Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!
s1/s1_e8.txt:99:Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
s1/s1_e8.txt:101:Phoebe: Thanks!
s1/s1_e8.txt:103:Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
s1/s1_e8.txt:107:Mrs. Geller: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
s1/s1_e8.txt:112:Ross: Here's my retainer!
s1/s1_e8.txt:115:Monica: Dad!
s1/s1_e8.txt:116:Mr. Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
s1/s1_e8.txt:120:Mr. Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
s1/s1_e8.txt:122:Mr. Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
s1/s1_e8.txt:129:Shelley: Oh! Okay! Phew!
s1/s1_e8.txt:135:Shelley: What? He's cute!
s1/s1_e8.txt:138:Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
s1/s1_e8.txt:147:Ross: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
s1/s1_e8.txt:148:Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!
s1/s1_e8.txt:157:Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
s1/s1_e8.txt:189:Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
s1/s1_e8.txt:191:Phoebe: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
s1/s1_e8.txt:193:All: God! Ross!
s1/s1_e8.txt:199:Ross: Oh! No-n-
s1/s1_e8.txt:207:Phoebe: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
s1/s1_e8.txt:210:Ross: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
s1/s1_e8.txt:211:Phoebe: Ooh! That's so nice...
s1/s1_e8.txt:212:Ross: ...Chandler!
s1/s1_e8.txt:219:Rachel: You!
s1/s1_e8.txt:220:Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
s1/s1_e8.txt:226:Mr. Geller: Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
s1/s1_e8.txt:249:Mr. Geller: Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
s1/s1_e8.txt:261:Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
s1/s1_e9.txt:55:Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
s1/s1_e9.txt:94:Rachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!
s1/s1_e9.txt:119:Joey: Wait, wait, wait!
s1/s1_e9.txt:134:Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
s1/s1_e9.txt:140:Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
s1/s1_e9.txt:145:Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
s1/s1_e9.txt:149:Monica: Ah!
s1/s1_e9.txt:153:Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
s1/s1_e9.txt:158:Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
s1/s1_e9.txt:166:Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!
s1/s1_e9.txt:187:Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
s1/s1_e9.txt:189:Monica: Well then get it, get it!
s1/s1_e9.txt:191:Monica: (angry) Joey!
s1/s1_e9.txt:200:Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:204:Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!
s1/s1_e9.txt:206:Susan: I felt it!
s1/s1_e9.txt:224:Rachel: Because!
s1/s1_e9.txt:226:Rachel: Because!
s1/s1_e9.txt:227:Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
s1/s1_e9.txt:234:Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
s1/s1_e9.txt:239:Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
s1/s1_e9.txt:246:Joey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
s1/s1_e9.txt:247:Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
s1/s1_e9.txt:264:Chandler: Here, here!
