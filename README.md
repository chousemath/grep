# Learning `grep`

# The history of grep

* Invented by Ken Thompson for searching through files.
* Thompson chose the name because in ed (a text editor created by Thompson), the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a previously defined pattern.
* The `egrep` variant supports an extended regular expression syntax.
* The `fgrep` variant searches for any of a list of fixed strings using the Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm.
* Functionalities of these variants are included in grep as the command-line switches -E and -F (example included below).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# General formula
$ grep option search_pattern file_path

# Searching a pattern from a single file
$ grep fun s1_e1.txt
$ grep Yes s1_e1.txt

# Search a pattern in multiple files
$ grep funny s1_e1.txt s1_e2.txt s1_e3.txt
$ grep why s1_e1.txt s1_e2.txt s1_e3.txt
$ grep "thank you" s1_e1.txt s1_e2.txt s1_e3.txt

# Search a pattern in any files with the .txt extension
$ grep funny *.txt*

# Redirecting output to a file
$ grep funny *.txt* > occurrences_of_funny.txt

# Case insensitive search for a pattern
$ grep -i yes *.txt* > occurrences_of_yes.txt

# Searching a pattern in sub-directories
$ grep -i always s1/*.txt* > occurrences_of_always.txt

# Display line number for search pattern
$ grep -i -n forever s1/*.txt* > occurrences_of_forever.txt

# Print lines starting with the pattern
# Get all of Ross' lines in Season 1 of Friends
$ grep -n ^Ross s1/*.txt* > occurrences_of_ross.txt
$ grep -n ^Monica s1/*.txt* > occurrences_of_monica.txt

# Print lines ending with the pattern
$ grep -n ?$ s1/*.txt* > occurrences_of_questions.txt

# Print all lines excluding the matched ones
$ grep -i -v chandler s1/*.txt* > occurrences_without_chandler.txt

# Find the words that contains any character
$ grep -n .! s1/*.txt* > occurrences_with_exclamation.txt

# Combining grep with another command
curl https://fangj.github.io/friends/season/0201.html | grep -i chandler > occurrences_with_chandler.html

# Combined word search using extended words
$ grep -Ew 'Monica:|Chandler:' s1/*.txt* > occurences_with_monica_or_chandler.txt

# Counting the number of occurrences acroos all text files
$ grep -c -i friend s1/*.txt*

# Searching for all lines starting with a letter
$ grep '^[[:alpha:]]' s1/*.txt*

# Searching for all lines starting with a letter or number
$ grep '^[[:alnum:]]' s1/*.txt*
```
