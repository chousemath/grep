s1/s1_e1.txt:61:Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
s1/s1_e1.txt:74:Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
s1/s1_e1.txt:85:Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
s1/s1_e1.txt:141:Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
s1/s1_e1.txt:313:Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
s1/s1_e10.txt:96:Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:42:Jay Leno: (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
s1/s1_e11.txt:247:Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
s1/s1_e11.txt:248:Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
s1/s1_e12.txt:304:Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
s1/s1_e13.txt:69:Mr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
s1/s1_e13.txt:167:Joey: I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
s1/s1_e13.txt:169:Joey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
s1/s1_e13.txt:225:Mrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
s1/s1_e14.txt:102:Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
s1/s1_e14.txt:138:Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
s1/s1_e15.txt:103:Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
s1/s1_e15.txt:168:Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
s1/s1_e16.txt:52:Phoebe: It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
s1/s1_e16.txt:278:Ross: I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
s1/s1_e16.txt:321:Phoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
s1/s1_e17.txt:117:Mr. Geller: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
s1/s1_e19.txt:144:Phoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!
s1/s1_e2.txt:11:Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
s1/s1_e2.txt:118:Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
s1/s1_e20.txt:232:Barry: ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
s1/s1_e20.txt:234:Barry: (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
s1/s1_e22.txt:140:Young Ethan: Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.
s1/s1_e23.txt:316:Monica: (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
s1/s1_e23.txt:319:Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns)
s1/s1_e24.txt:46:Monica: Joey... we always know what you mean.
s1/s1_e24.txt:196:Melanie: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
s1/s1_e24.txt:225:Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
s1/s1_e3.txt:12:Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
s1/s1_e3.txt:225:Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
s1/s1_e4.txt:8:Rachel: See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.)
s1/s1_e5.txt:246:Chandler: We should always always break up together.
s1/s1_e6.txt:5:Chandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
s1/s1_e6.txt:32:Phoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
s1/s1_e7.txt:148:Phoebe: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
s1/s1_e8.txt:59:Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
s1/s1_e8.txt:99:Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
s1/s1_e9.txt:145:Joey: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
s1/s1_e9.txt:202:Ross: Does it always, uh--?
