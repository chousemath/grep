s1/s1_e1.txt:8:Chandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
s1/s1_e1.txt:9:Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?
s1/s1_e1.txt:18:Joey: Instead of...?
s1/s1_e1.txt:28:Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?
s1/s1_e1.txt:30:Chandler: Cookie?
s1/s1_e1.txt:36:Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:42:Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
s1/s1_e1.txt:43:Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
s1/s1_e1.txt:45:Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
s1/s1_e1.txt:47:Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
s1/s1_e1.txt:55:Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?
s1/s1_e1.txt:56:Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
s1/s1_e1.txt:60:Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
s1/s1_e1.txt:87:Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?
s1/s1_e1.txt:92:Joey: Who's Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:93:Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:94:Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
s1/s1_e1.txt:95:Ross: He finally asked you out?
s1/s1_e1.txt:100:Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:102:Monica: (horrified) Really?
s1/s1_e1.txt:108:Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:110:Ross: A wandering?
s1/s1_e1.txt:115:Paul: Yeah?
s1/s1_e1.txt:118:Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
s1/s1_e1.txt:124:Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
s1/s1_e1.txt:134:Joey: (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
s1/s1_e1.txt:136:Joey: Which goes where?
s1/s1_e1.txt:144:Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
s1/s1_e1.txt:151:Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
s1/s1_e1.txt:152:Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:154:Monica: -leg?
s1/s1_e1.txt:171:Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
s1/s1_e1.txt:173:Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
s1/s1_e1.txt:174:Paul: Isn't there?
s1/s1_e1.txt:175:Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
s1/s1_e1.txt:179:Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
s1/s1_e1.txt:182:Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
s1/s1_e1.txt:188:Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
s1/s1_e1.txt:207:Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:214:Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
s1/s1_e1.txt:218:Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?
s1/s1_e1.txt:221:Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
s1/s1_e1.txt:224:Joey: Look, it was a job all right?
s1/s1_e1.txt:231:Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
s1/s1_e1.txt:239:Monica: What for?
s1/s1_e1.txt:244:Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
s1/s1_e1.txt:245:Frannie: You had sex, didn't you?
s1/s1_e1.txt:246:Monica: How do you do that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:247:Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?
s1/s1_e1.txt:248:Monica: You know Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:250:Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:254:Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:258:Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
s1/s1_e1.txt:260:Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?
s1/s1_e1.txt:263:Rachel: Guess what?
s1/s1_e1.txt:264:Ross: You got a job?
s1/s1_e1.txt:270:Monica: How'd you pay for them?
s1/s1_e1.txt:272:Monica: And who pays for that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:283:Monica: All right, you ready?
s1/s1_e1.txt:297:Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
s1/s1_e1.txt:299:Monica: You be okay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:301:Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
s1/s1_e1.txt:309:Ross: Split it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:315:Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
s1/s1_e1.txt:321:Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
s1/s1_e1.txt:329:Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop?
s1/s1_e1.txt:330:Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?
s1/s1_e1.txt:335:Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
s1/s1_e1.txt:336:Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:340:Customer: (To Rachel) Ahh, miss?   More coffee?
s1/s1_e10.txt:7:Monica: W-wait. What is that?
s1/s1_e10.txt:8:Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
s1/s1_e10.txt:10:Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
s1/s1_e10.txt:12:Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
s1/s1_e10.txt:14:Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
s1/s1_e10.txt:16:Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
s1/s1_e10.txt:24:Monica: So, how'd it go?
s1/s1_e10.txt:28:Monica: So what are you gonna be?
s1/s1_e10.txt:29:Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
s1/s1_e10.txt:30:Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
s1/s1_e10.txt:45:That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
s1/s1_e10.txt:57:Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
s1/s1_e10.txt:62:Phoebe: Could you speak up please?
s1/s1_e10.txt:72:Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
s1/s1_e10.txt:76:Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
s1/s1_e10.txt:80:Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
s1/s1_e10.txt:95:Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
s1/s1_e10.txt:96:Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
s1/s1_e10.txt:105:Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
s1/s1_e10.txt:112:David: ...Now? Now?
s1/s1_e10.txt:116:David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
s1/s1_e10.txt:120:Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
s1/s1_e10.txt:122:Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
s1/s1_e10.txt:124:Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?
s1/s1_e10.txt:135:Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
s1/s1_e10.txt:136:Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
s1/s1_e10.txt:139:Monica: What's the matter?
s1/s1_e10.txt:144:Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing?
s1/s1_e10.txt:150:Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
s1/s1_e10.txt:151:Max: No. Have you seen David?
s1/s1_e10.txt:154:Phoebe: Minsk?
s1/s1_e10.txt:158:Phoebe: So when, when do you leave?
s1/s1_e10.txt:162:Phoebe: Hello?
s1/s1_e10.txt:165:David: Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
s1/s1_e10.txt:168:Phoebe: Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
s1/s1_e10.txt:171:Phoebe: So-so you're really not going?
s1/s1_e10.txt:195:Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?
s1/s1_e10.txt:199:Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
s1/s1_e10.txt:205:Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
s1/s1_e10.txt:207:Phoebe: And then... your face is bloated?
s1/s1_e10.txt:208:Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
s1/s1_e10.txt:224:Joey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
s1/s1_e10.txt:240:Phoebe: Are you alright?
s1/s1_e10.txt:256:Joey: You seen Sandy?
s1/s1_e10.txt:259:All: (in the kitchen) What?
s1/s1_e10.txt:270:Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?
s1/s1_e11.txt:4:Phoebe: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
s1/s1_e11.txt:5:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e11.txt:26:Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
s1/s1_e11.txt:28:Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:37:Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
s1/s1_e11.txt:47:Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
s1/s1_e11.txt:56:Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
s1/s1_e11.txt:61:Jay Leno: (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
s1/s1_e11.txt:62:Phoebe: Your mom was arrested?
s1/s1_e11.txt:65:Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:69:Jay Leno: (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
s1/s1_e11.txt:82:Phoebe: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
s1/s1_e11.txt:87:Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
s1/s1_e11.txt:92:Mrs. Bing: Who's doing shots?
s1/s1_e11.txt:95:Mrs. Bing: There y'go. Ross?
s1/s1_e11.txt:101:Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?
s1/s1_e11.txt:107:Mrs. Bing: Yeah, any messages for room 226?
s1/s1_e11.txt:109:Mrs. Bing: You okay there, slugger?
s1/s1_e11.txt:111:Mrs. Bing: What is with you tonight?
s1/s1_e11.txt:117:Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
s1/s1_e11.txt:118:Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:120:Ross: When?
s1/s1_e11.txt:122:Ross: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:135:Ross: Hey, is Chandler here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:138:Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
s1/s1_e11.txt:142:Ross: What code?
s1/s1_e11.txt:145:Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:152:Joey: Ross, how could you let this happen?
s1/s1_e11.txt:154:Joey: You don't think my mom's sexy?
s1/s1_e11.txt:156:Joey: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
s1/s1_e11.txt:161:Rachel: What're you guys doing out here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:170:Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?
s1/s1_e11.txt:172:Joey: So are you gonna tell him?
s1/s1_e11.txt:173:Ross: Why would I tell him?
s1/s1_e11.txt:176:Monica: (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:178:Monica: ...What did I ask?
s1/s1_e11.txt:182:Monica: What are you doing here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:183:Phoebe: Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:184:Monica: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
s1/s1_e11.txt:185:Phoebe: No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
s1/s1_e11.txt:191:Chandler: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
s1/s1_e11.txt:193:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e11.txt:195:Chandler: (To Joey) You knew about this?
s1/s1_e11.txt:200:Chandler: (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
s1/s1_e11.txt:211:Joey: (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
s1/s1_e11.txt:218:Rachel: Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
s1/s1_e11.txt:224:Phoebe: Going to the hospital tonight?
s1/s1_e11.txt:225:Monica: No, you?
s1/s1_e11.txt:226:Phoebe: No, you?
s1/s1_e11.txt:228:Phoebe: Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?
s1/s1_e11.txt:242:Chandler: What was that?
s1/s1_e11.txt:248:Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
s1/s1_e11.txt:252:Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?
s1/s1_e11.txt:253:Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
s1/s1_e11.txt:257:Phoebe: Alright, whadyou do with him?
s1/s1_e11.txt:260:Phoebe: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
s1/s1_e11.txt:263:Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
s1/s1_e11.txt:268:Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
s1/s1_e11.txt:278:Phoebe: What, that's it?
s1/s1_e11.txt:280:Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?
s1/s1_e11.txt:287:Mrs. Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
s1/s1_e11.txt:293:Mrs. Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
s1/s1_e11.txt:304:Ross: So, what's going on now?
s1/s1_e11.txt:306:Ross: Whaddya see?
s1/s1_e11.txt:309:Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?
s1/s1_e11.txt:319:Ross: You mean that?
s1/s1_e11.txt:321:Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?
s1/s1_e11.txt:323:Ross: Well, howdya feel?
s1/s1_e11.txt:329:Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
s1/s1_e12.txt:10:Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
s1/s1_e12.txt:15:Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
s1/s1_e12.txt:25:Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?
s1/s1_e12.txt:32:Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
s1/s1_e12.txt:42:Chandler: You think?
s1/s1_e12.txt:50:Ross: (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
s1/s1_e12.txt:53:Ross: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
s1/s1_e12.txt:56:Carol: Don't you want to know about the sex?
s1/s1_e12.txt:60:Carol: Do you want to know?
s1/s1_e12.txt:65:Susan: So, so, did you hear?
s1/s1_e12.txt:67:Susan: Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It really is...do we know...?
s1/s1_e12.txt:70:Susan: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
s1/s1_e12.txt:72:Ross: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
s1/s1_e12.txt:78:Carol: Hello?
s1/s1_e12.txt:81:Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
s1/s1_e12.txt:84:Joey: How'd you get to that?
s1/s1_e12.txt:86:Joey: You knew about that?
s1/s1_e12.txt:88:Joey: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
s1/s1_e12.txt:89:Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
s1/s1_e12.txt:91:Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?
s1/s1_e12.txt:92:Joey: Why not?
s1/s1_e12.txt:93:Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
s1/s1_e12.txt:94:Joey: Why, are you moving out?
s1/s1_e12.txt:100:Joey: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
s1/s1_e12.txt:107:Phoebe: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
s1/s1_e12.txt:108:Paolo: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
s1/s1_e12.txt:112:Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
s1/s1_e12.txt:128:Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?
s1/s1_e12.txt:130:Customer: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
s1/s1_e12.txt:134:Monica: Phoebe, what is it?
s1/s1_e12.txt:135:Phoebe: All right, you know Paolo?
s1/s1_e12.txt:143:Monica: Well, what happened?
s1/s1_e12.txt:148:Monica: Are you sure?
s1/s1_e12.txt:152:Monica: Was it...?
s1/s1_e12.txt:156:Rachel: "Ooo," what?
s1/s1_e12.txt:163:Chandler: So what are you gonna do?
s1/s1_e12.txt:173:Chandler: (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
s1/s1_e12.txt:176:Joey: All right, how about the ladybugs?
s1/s1_e12.txt:183:Phoebe: Are you moving out?
s1/s1_e12.txt:185:Phoebe: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
s1/s1_e12.txt:198:Chandler: So, what do you think?
s1/s1_e12.txt:202:Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
s1/s1_e12.txt:207:Phoebe: Are you okay?
s1/s1_e12.txt:209:Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
s1/s1_e12.txt:215:Phoebe: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
s1/s1_e12.txt:224:Rachel: (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
s1/s1_e12.txt:229:Phoebe: Should I not have told you?
s1/s1_e12.txt:239:Ross: What, now?
s1/s1_e12.txt:245:Ross: (entering) How's it going?
s1/s1_e12.txt:261:Ross: You all right?
s1/s1_e12.txt:265:Ross: What?
s1/s1_e12.txt:271:Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
s1/s1_e12.txt:273:Phoebe: You ok?
s1/s1_e12.txt:274:Rachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
s1/s1_e12.txt:280:Ross: (astonished) What?
s1/s1_e12.txt:281:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e12.txt:282:Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
s1/s1_e12.txt:284:Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
s1/s1_e12.txt:290:Joey and Chandler: What is it?
s1/s1_e12.txt:305:Chandler: (to Joey) One more game?
s1/s1_e13.txt:9:Chandler: Can I just say one thing?
s1/s1_e13.txt:22:Phoebe: Isn't he great?
s1/s1_e13.txt:24:Phoebe: I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
s1/s1_e13.txt:25:Monica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
s1/s1_e13.txt:27:Rachel: Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?
s1/s1_e13.txt:29:Rachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
s1/s1_e13.txt:31:Roger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?
s1/s1_e13.txt:33:Ross: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
s1/s1_e13.txt:35:Rachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
s1/s1_e13.txt:42:Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
s1/s1_e13.txt:46:Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?
s1/s1_e13.txt:49:Joey: Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
s1/s1_e13.txt:51:Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?
s1/s1_e13.txt:57:Mr. Tribbiani: (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
s1/s1_e13.txt:63:Joey: (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
s1/s1_e13.txt:67:Mr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
s1/s1_e13.txt:69:Mr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
s1/s1_e13.txt:78:Rachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
s1/s1_e13.txt:79:Chandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
s1/s1_e13.txt:80:Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
s1/s1_e13.txt:82:Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?
s1/s1_e13.txt:86:Monica: Hello?
s1/s1_e13.txt:91:Joey: What's the matter with Rog?
s1/s1_e13.txt:96:Ross: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
s1/s1_e13.txt:98:Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
s1/s1_e13.txt:104:Phoebe: Isn't he good?
s1/s1_e13.txt:111:Phoebe: Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
s1/s1_e13.txt:122:Joey: Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:125:Ronni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
s1/s1_e13.txt:126:Chandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
s1/s1_e13.txt:135:Mr. Tribbiani: Huh?
s1/s1_e13.txt:137:Mr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
s1/s1_e13.txt:140:Chandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
s1/s1_e13.txt:143:Ronni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
s1/s1_e13.txt:150:Mr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?
s1/s1_e13.txt:157:Mr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?
s1/s1_e13.txt:164:Chandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
s1/s1_e13.txt:168:Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
s1/s1_e13.txt:170:Chandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
s1/s1_e13.txt:173:Joey: You really think so?
s1/s1_e13.txt:179:Monica: Hi...May I help you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:180:Ronni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
s1/s1_e13.txt:181:Monica: Okay...who are you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:182:Ronni: Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
s1/s1_e13.txt:189:Rachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
s1/s1_e13.txt:190:Ronni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
s1/s1_e13.txt:198:Chandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?
s1/s1_e13.txt:204:Monica: How's it going?
s1/s1_e13.txt:207:Phoebe: So what's going on?
s1/s1_e13.txt:214:Phoebe: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
s1/s1_e13.txt:218:Joey: Ma! What're you doing here?
s1/s1_e13.txt:222:Joey: Hold on, you-you knew?
s1/s1_e13.txt:226:Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:228:Joey: I'm...happy...for you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:231:Mrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
s1/s1_e13.txt:233:Mrs. Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?
s1/s1_e13.txt:236:Roger: What's wrong, sweetie?
s1/s1_e13.txt:242:Roger: What?
s1/s1_e13.txt:254:Ross: So Joey, you okay?
s1/s1_e13.txt:260:Monica: How's it going?
s1/s1_e13.txt:265:Rachel: What happened?
s1/s1_e13.txt:269:Phoebe: Hey, Joey. What's going on?
s1/s1_e14.txt:7:Chandler: Any contact?
s1/s1_e14.txt:15:Ross: An egg?
s1/s1_e14.txt:21:Joey: Think it'll work?
s1/s1_e14.txt:25:Rachel: Do what, do what?
s1/s1_e14.txt:27:Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
s1/s1_e14.txt:30:Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
s1/s1_e14.txt:37:Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
s1/s1_e14.txt:39:Joey: (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
s1/s1_e14.txt:42:Chandler: ...And what did you bring?
s1/s1_e14.txt:44:Chandler: Janice?
s1/s1_e14.txt:56:Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?
s1/s1_e14.txt:62:Monica: There's more beer, right?
s1/s1_e14.txt:66:Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
s1/s1_e14.txt:68:Rachel: Or?
s1/s1_e14.txt:74:Joey: Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
s1/s1_e14.txt:80:Chandler: (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
s1/s1_e14.txt:81:Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
s1/s1_e14.txt:88:Lorraine: (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
s1/s1_e14.txt:96:Chandler: Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
s1/s1_e14.txt:97:Janice: So, do we have the best friends or what?
s1/s1_e14.txt:98:Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
s1/s1_e14.txt:100:Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
s1/s1_e14.txt:106:Janice: Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
s1/s1_e14.txt:131:Kristin: That's funny. Who are they?
s1/s1_e14.txt:135:Kristin: Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
s1/s1_e14.txt:144:Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?
s1/s1_e14.txt:156:Chandler: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
s1/s1_e14.txt:166:Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?
s1/s1_e14.txt:172:Ross: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
s1/s1_e14.txt:176:Fireman No. 1: What do we got there?
s1/s1_e14.txt:181:Rachel: Really?
s1/s1_e14.txt:189:Chandler: (surprised) It is?
s1/s1_e14.txt:194:Janice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
s1/s1_e14.txt:201:Ross: You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?
s1/s1_e14.txt:217:Fireman No. 3: We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
s1/s1_e14.txt:218:Rachel: So, um, will you bring the truck?
s1/s1_e14.txt:225:Fireman No. 1: You guys tell them you were married?
s1/s1_e15.txt:9:Monica: Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
s1/s1_e15.txt:10:Rachel: Yeah?
s1/s1_e15.txt:11:Monica: Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
s1/s1_e15.txt:25:Ross: What's going on?
s1/s1_e15.txt:26:All: What is it?
s1/s1_e15.txt:30:All: Why?
s1/s1_e15.txt:34:Phoebe: So was it a lot more money?
s1/s1_e15.txt:37:Rachel: ... the WENUS?
s1/s1_e15.txt:40:Joey: So what're you going to do?
s1/s1_e15.txt:47:Monica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
s1/s1_e15.txt:50:Phoebe: Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
s1/s1_e15.txt:54:Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
s1/s1_e15.txt:56:Phoebe: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
s1/s1_e15.txt:58:Rachel: Career counselor?
s1/s1_e15.txt:66:Rachel: The meeting with the guy went great?
s1/s1_e15.txt:68:Chandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
s1/s1_e15.txt:70:Rachel: What are you going to make?
s1/s1_e15.txt:72:Rachel: (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
s1/s1_e15.txt:75:Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
s1/s1_e15.txt:77:Ross: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
s1/s1_e15.txt:78:Chandler: Who are you going out with?
s1/s1_e15.txt:79:Phoebe: Oh, is this the bug lady?
s1/s1_e15.txt:82:Rachel: So what are you guys going to do?
s1/s1_e15.txt:85:Joey: (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
s1/s1_e15.txt:95:Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
s1/s1_e15.txt:97:Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?
s1/s1_e15.txt:98:Joey: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
s1/s1_e15.txt:100:Rachel: My God! What happened to you?
s1/s1_e15.txt:111:Phoebe: Ten dollars an hour for what?
s1/s1_e15.txt:113:Rachel: (hurt) Waitressing?
s1/s1_e15.txt:116:Rachel: But, but?
s1/s1_e15.txt:124:Ross: (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
s1/s1_e15.txt:129:Celia: What?
s1/s1_e15.txt:132:Joey: (in disbelief) Vulva?
s1/s1_e15.txt:134:Joey: (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
s1/s1_e15.txt:135:Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
s1/s1_e15.txt:140:Joey: ....yeah... what else?
s1/s1_e15.txt:142:Joey: (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
s1/s1_e15.txt:148:Joey: Come on! You like this woman, right?
s1/s1_e15.txt:150:Joey: You want to see her again, right?
s1/s1_e15.txt:165:Chandler: (smiling)....with??
s1/s1_e15.txt:170:Chandler: Again?
s1/s1_e15.txt:174:Chandler: Well?
s1/s1_e15.txt:182:Chandler: This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
s1/s1_e15.txt:189:Rachel: Who was that?
s1/s1_e15.txt:199:Rachel: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
s1/s1_e15.txt:206:Monica: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
s1/s1_e15.txt:209:Rachel: What's up?
s1/s1_e15.txt:211:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e15.txt:212:Phoebe: Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
s1/s1_e15.txt:222:Rachel: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
s1/s1_e15.txt:239:Steve: What?
s1/s1_e15.txt:240:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e15.txt:241:Steve: Why?
s1/s1_e15.txt:242:Monica: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
s1/s1_e15.txt:253:Joey: (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
s1/s1_e15.txt:257:Joey: Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
s1/s1_e15.txt:261:Phoebe: You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
s1/s1_e15.txt:262:Rachel: Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
s1/s1_e15.txt:263:Joey: Yeah, where the hell is he?
s1/s1_e16.txt:7:Joey: There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
s1/s1_e16.txt:11:Ursula: Hi. Okay, will that be all?
s1/s1_e16.txt:12:Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
s1/s1_e16.txt:14:Joey: No, no... how come you are working here?
s1/s1_e16.txt:16:Chandler: Can we start over?
s1/s1_e16.txt:31:Chandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
s1/s1_e16.txt:48:Phoebe: Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
s1/s1_e16.txt:50:Phoebe: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?
s1/s1_e16.txt:51:Rachel: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?
s1/s1_e16.txt:55:Rachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
s1/s1_e16.txt:57:Rachel: Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?
s1/s1_e16.txt:64:Teacher: Good for you. Alrighty, next?
s1/s1_e16.txt:65:Ross: Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and err ah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..who’s next?
s1/s1_e16.txt:66:Teacher: I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?
s1/s1_e16.txt:89:Nina: You wanted to see me?
s1/s1_e16.txt:91:Nina: Which is bad, because?
s1/s1_e16.txt:93:Nina: Your... excuse me?
s1/s1_e16.txt:107:Ross: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
s1/s1_e16.txt:108:Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
s1/s1_e16.txt:111:Rachel: Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
s1/s1_e16.txt:113:Chandler: Hey, where you been?
s1/s1_e16.txt:118:Joey: Pheebs?
s1/s1_e16.txt:119:Phoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?
s1/s1_e16.txt:120:Joey: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
s1/s1_e16.txt:121:Phoebe: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?
s1/s1_e16.txt:126:Ross: You okay?
s1/s1_e16.txt:128:Ross: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
s1/s1_e16.txt:132:Ross: Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?
s1/s1_e16.txt:138:Ross and Susan: What? What? What?
s1/s1_e16.txt:139:Susan: I am supposed to be the mommy?
s1/s1_e16.txt:142:Ross: I see. So what do you propose to do?
s1/s1_e16.txt:152:Chandler: Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?
s1/s1_e16.txt:154:Chandler: And?
s1/s1_e16.txt:156:Chandler: So what does this mean?
s1/s1_e16.txt:159:Mr. Douglas: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
s1/s1_e16.txt:163:Nina: Are you okay?
s1/s1_e16.txt:165:Nina: (Taking her hand away) What?
s1/s1_e16.txt:166:Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
s1/s1_e16.txt:169:Rachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
s1/s1_e16.txt:171:Rachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
s1/s1_e16.txt:175:Jamie: What is this place?
s1/s1_e16.txt:176:Fran: Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign) ..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
s1/s1_e16.txt:179:Fran: What’s she doing here?
s1/s1_e16.txt:181:Fran: Think she got fired at Riff’s?
s1/s1_e16.txt:182:Jamie: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory) ..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?
s1/s1_e16.txt:187:Phoebe: Yeah?
s1/s1_e16.txt:190:Jamie: So, so you’re here too?
s1/s1_e16.txt:204:Monica: I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?
s1/s1_e16.txt:207:Chandler: I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?
s1/s1_e16.txt:230:Rachel: Are you seein’ her again tonight?
s1/s1_e16.txt:266:Susan: What is, honey?
s1/s1_e16.txt:274:Susan: I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
s1/s1_e16.txt:277:Rachel: This is just occurring to you?
s1/s1_e16.txt:280:Ross: Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
s1/s1_e16.txt:283:Phoebe: Where’re you going?
s1/s1_e16.txt:285:Phoebe: With?
s1/s1_e16.txt:287:Phoebe: Alright, could I just ask you one question?
s1/s1_e16.txt:289:Phoebe: Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
s1/s1_e16.txt:290:Joey: Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, okay?
s1/s1_e16.txt:292:Joey: You meant sex, right?
s1/s1_e16.txt:295:Nina: Do you have a sec?
s1/s1_e16.txt:296:Chandler: Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?
s1/s1_e16.txt:301:Nina: I am?
s1/s1_e16.txt:302:Chandler: Sure, why not?
s1/s1_e16.txt:304:Chandler: Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
s1/s1_e16.txt:305:Helen: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
s1/s1_e16.txt:306:Nina: What?
s1/s1_e16.txt:307:Chandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
s1/s1_e16.txt:311:Rachel: Oh, how’d she take it?
s1/s1_e16.txt:318:Monica: Are you alright?
s1/s1_e16.txt:320:Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
s1/s1_e16.txt:321:Phoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
s1/s1_e16.txt:338:Ursula: Yeah, um, may we help you?
s1/s1_e16.txt:341:Monica: Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
s1/s1_e16.txt:346:Rachel: (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
s1/s1_e17.txt:9:Nurse: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
s1/s1_e17.txt:15:Monica: Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
s1/s1_e17.txt:17:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e17.txt:19:Monica: Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
s1/s1_e17.txt:21:Monica: (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
s1/s1_e17.txt:22:Rachel: Why, how much is this gonna cost?
s1/s1_e17.txt:24:Rachel: Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:28:Rachel: (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
s1/s1_e17.txt:34:Nurse: Why?
s1/s1_e17.txt:45:Joey: He should take the sack?
s1/s1_e17.txt:50:Joey: Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
s1/s1_e17.txt:53:Ross: Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
s1/s1_e17.txt:54:Joey: When's that?
s1/s1_e17.txt:56:Joey: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
s1/s1_e17.txt:60:Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:62:Chandler: And your friend Phoebe?
s1/s1_e17.txt:63:Joey: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
s1/s1_e17.txt:69:Dr. Mitchell: Okay, errrr, Monica?
s1/s1_e17.txt:76:Rachel: Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
s1/s1_e17.txt:77:Dr. Rosen: Excuse me?
s1/s1_e17.txt:87:Chandler: Alright, what have we learned so far?
s1/s1_e17.txt:92:Rachel: Was that the cake?
s1/s1_e17.txt:103:Phoebe: Hey, what's going on?
s1/s1_e17.txt:106:Phoebe: (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?
s1/s1_e17.txt:108:Chandler: Did you see Betty?
s1/s1_e17.txt:112:Ross: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
s1/s1_e17.txt:114:Ross: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
s1/s1_e17.txt:115:Mr. Geller: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
s1/s1_e17.txt:117:Mr. Geller: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
s1/s1_e17.txt:118:Ross: Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
s1/s1_e17.txt:121:Mr. Geller: So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
s1/s1_e17.txt:133:Dr. Mitchell: Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
s1/s1_e17.txt:135:Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, how's the ankle?
s1/s1_e17.txt:143:Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
s1/s1_e17.txt:144:Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
s1/s1_e17.txt:146:Dr. Mitchell: So?
s1/s1_e17.txt:155:Rachel: You know what?
s1/s1_e17.txt:156:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e17.txt:157:Rachel: You know what?
s1/s1_e17.txt:158:Monica: What!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:159:Rachel: You know what?
s1/s1_e17.txt:160:Monica: (getting angry) What!!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:164:Dr. Rosen: This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
s1/s1_e17.txt:168:Dr. Mitchell: Really?
s1/s1_e17.txt:169:Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
s1/s1_e17.txt:170:Dr. Rosen: So, Monica, what do you do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:178:Rachel: (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
s1/s1_e17.txt:186:Rachel: Would you excuse me for a second?
s1/s1_e17.txt:201:Rachel and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:205:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e17.txt:215:Phoebe: Trouble?
s1/s1_e17.txt:217:Phoebe: Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
s1/s1_e17.txt:218:Ross: Well did you try calling her?
s1/s1_e17.txt:225:Phoebe: Um you, you got a minute?
s1/s1_e17.txt:238:Phoebe: How'd you know I was coming?
s1/s1_e17.txt:245:Phoebe: So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
s1/s1_e17.txt:248:Phoebe: Does he know?
s1/s1_e17.txt:249:Ursula: Who?
s1/s1_e17.txt:251:Ursula: He is? Why?
s1/s1_e17.txt:255:Ursula: Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
s1/s1_e17.txt:257:Phoebe: So, um, are you gonna call him?
s1/s1_e17.txt:258:Ursula: What? (Indicating the departing waiter) Do you think he likes me?
s1/s1_e17.txt:260:Ursula: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. (Offering to share her food) Do you want some chicken?
s1/s1_e17.txt:267:Rachel: (as Monica) Hi, remember us?
s1/s1_e17.txt:280:Ross: Do you have a point?
s1/s1_e17.txt:283:Chandler: What's up with the simian?
s1/s1_e17.txt:285:Chandler: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
s1/s1_e17.txt:288:Ross: I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
s1/s1_e17.txt:295:Monica: What's goin' on?
s1/s1_e17.txt:308:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e17.txt:322:Joey: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
s1/s1_e17.txt:329:Joey: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
s1/s1_e17.txt:330:Phoebe: (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
s1/s1_e17.txt:339:Phoebe: Really?
s1/s1_e17.txt:341:Joey: Pheebs?
s1/s1_e17.txt:347:Phoebe: Is he alright?
s1/s1_e17.txt:352:Chandler: (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
s1/s1_e17.txt:353:Ross: No, why?
s1/s1_e17.txt:357:Ross: (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?
s1/s1_e18.txt:5:Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
s1/s1_e18.txt:8:Ross: Rach, did you proofread these?
s1/s1_e18.txt:9:Rachel: Uh... yeah, why?
s1/s1_e18.txt:11:Rachel: (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
s1/s1_e18.txt:17:Rachel: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly): Did you bring the mail?
s1/s1_e18.txt:24:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:28:Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
s1/s1_e18.txt:30:Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
s1/s1_e18.txt:32:Chandler: ...little playthings with yarn?
s1/s1_e18.txt:33:Ross: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:34:Chandler: Could you want her more?
s1/s1_e18.txt:35:Ross: Who?
s1/s1_e18.txt:38:Rachel: Hi! How are you?
s1/s1_e18.txt:44:Phoebe: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:48:Joey: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
s1/s1_e18.txt:51:Rachel: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
s1/s1_e18.txt:52:Phoebe: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
s1/s1_e18.txt:54:Phoebe: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
s1/s1_e18.txt:61:Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
s1/s1_e18.txt:71:Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
s1/s1_e18.txt:90:Joey: About what?
s1/s1_e18.txt:93:Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
s1/s1_e18.txt:97:Rachel: Settle what?
s1/s1_e18.txt:101:Joey: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
s1/s1_e18.txt:110:Joey: (pause)...Yeah?
s1/s1_e18.txt:114:Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
s1/s1_e18.txt:115:Ross: You still on that?
s1/s1_e18.txt:121:Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
s1/s1_e18.txt:126:Rachel: (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
s1/s1_e18.txt:129:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:132:Rachel: Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
s1/s1_e18.txt:135:Monica: You're kidding! Where? Where?
s1/s1_e18.txt:139:Monica: Well, what's the job?
s1/s1_e18.txt:143:Aunt Iris: Is Tony Randall dead?
s1/s1_e18.txt:146:Rachel: Why?
s1/s1_e18.txt:148:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:150:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e18.txt:157:Phoebe: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
s1/s1_e18.txt:165:Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
s1/s1_e18.txt:171:Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
s1/s1_e18.txt:173:Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
s1/s1_e18.txt:175:Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
s1/s1_e18.txt:184:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:194:Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
s1/s1_e18.txt:197:Monica: Excuse me, where are you going?
s1/s1_e18.txt:199:Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
s1/s1_e18.txt:210:Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
s1/s1_e18.txt:212:Joey: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
s1/s1_e18.txt:224:Rachel: I couldn't be inner. Monica?
s1/s1_e18.txt:225:Phoebe: Monica, in or out?
s1/s1_e18.txt:230:Phoebe: Ross?
s1/s1_e18.txt:232:Phoebe: Chandler?
s1/s1_e18.txt:235:Rachel: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?
s1/s1_e18.txt:236:Ross: No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
s1/s1_e18.txt:268:Rachel: Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
s1/s1_e18.txt:270:Rachel: (to Ross): Loser?
s1/s1_e18.txt:273:Rachel: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
s1/s1_e18.txt:276:Rachel: How many you want?
s1/s1_e18.txt:278:Rachel: Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
s1/s1_e18.txt:293:Joey: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:295:Chandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
s1/s1_e18.txt:301:Ross: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
s1/s1_e18.txt:318:Phoebe: That's a bird?
s1/s1_e18.txt:329:Monica: That, you get? That, you get?
s1/s1_e19.txt:10:Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
s1/s1_e19.txt:12:Monica: What is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:14:Monica: Barry who you almost...?
s1/s1_e19.txt:16:Monica: And Mindy, your maid of...?
s1/s1_e19.txt:20:Ross: Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
s1/s1_e19.txt:21:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e19.txt:26:Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
s1/s1_e19.txt:29:Rachel: Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
s1/s1_e19.txt:34:Rachel: Hi, how was the movie?
s1/s1_e19.txt:45:Chandler: They're still just friends, right?
s1/s1_e19.txt:48:Monica: Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
s1/s1_e19.txt:53:Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
s1/s1_e19.txt:55:Joey: She really said that?
s1/s1_e19.txt:57:Joey: 'Tonight' tonight?
s1/s1_e19.txt:65:Joey: How could you lose him?
s1/s1_e19.txt:67:Monica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
s1/s1_e19.txt:69:Monica: Which ones?
s1/s1_e19.txt:73:Phoebe: Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
s1/s1_e19.txt:75:Phoebe: Oh no, how?
s1/s1_e19.txt:77:Phoebe: Which one?
s1/s1_e19.txt:80:Rachel: C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
s1/s1_e19.txt:81:Joey: Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
s1/s1_e19.txt:85:Rachel: Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
s1/s1_e19.txt:90:Mr. Heckles: Whaddyou want?
s1/s1_e19.txt:91:Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:92:Mr. Heckles: I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:94:Phoebe: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
s1/s1_e19.txt:96:Monica: A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
s1/s1_e19.txt:102:Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
s1/s1_e19.txt:103:Rachel: Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
s1/s1_e19.txt:104:Ross: Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
s1/s1_e19.txt:105:Rachel: Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
s1/s1_e19.txt:110:Ross: Oh, what? What-what?
s1/s1_e19.txt:111:Rachel: Y'know Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:112:Ross: ...Yeah?
s1/s1_e19.txt:120:Rachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:123:Ross: You called Animal Control?
s1/s1_e19.txt:124:Rachel: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
s1/s1_e19.txt:130:Luisa: (Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?
s1/s1_e19.txt:138:Luisa: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:140:Phoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
s1/s1_e19.txt:141:Luisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
s1/s1_e19.txt:142:Phoebe: Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
s1/s1_e19.txt:143:Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
s1/s1_e19.txt:155:Luisa: Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
s1/s1_e19.txt:159:Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
s1/s1_e19.txt:163:Chandler: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:164:Joey: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:165:Chandler: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:166:Joey: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:168:Woman No. 1: Hi, can I help you?
s1/s1_e19.txt:172:Chandler: Yes have you seen any?
s1/s1_e19.txt:173:Woman No. 1: No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
s1/s1_e19.txt:174:Joey: Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
s1/s1_e19.txt:178:Woman No. 2: Did I put too much rum in here?
s1/s1_e19.txt:182:Joey: Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
s1/s1_e19.txt:187:Joey: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:190:Phoebe: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:191:Monica: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:192:Phoebe: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:193:Both: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:197:Monica: What is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:204:Monica: What're you gonna do?
s1/s1_e19.txt:207:Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
s1/s1_e19.txt:211:Ross: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:212:Rachel: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:223:Ross: Oh, forget it, okay?
s1/s1_e19.txt:225:Ross: What? What?
s1/s1_e19.txt:231:Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?
s1/s1_e19.txt:232:Mr. Heckles: What about it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:235:Rachel: Then what's with all the bananas?
s1/s1_e19.txt:238:Ross: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:240:Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?
s1/s1_e19.txt:258:Rachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
s1/s1_e19.txt:264:Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
s1/s1_e19.txt:275:Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
s1/s1_e19.txt:282:Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
s1/s1_e2.txt:5:Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
s1/s1_e2.txt:13:Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
s1/s1_e2.txt:16:Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
s1/s1_e2.txt:20:Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
s1/s1_e2.txt:21:Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
s1/s1_e2.txt:32:Carol: A lesbian?
s1/s1_e2.txt:33:Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
s1/s1_e2.txt:35:Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol?
s1/s1_e2.txt:41:Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
s1/s1_e2.txt:53:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e2.txt:57:Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
s1/s1_e2.txt:64:Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
s1/s1_e2.txt:68:Chandler: ...Dinah?
s1/s1_e2.txt:84:Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
s1/s1_e2.txt:85:Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
s1/s1_e2.txt:88:Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?
s1/s1_e2.txt:91:Rachel: So what are you gonna do?
s1/s1_e2.txt:94:Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
s1/s1_e2.txt:96:Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?
s1/s1_e2.txt:100:Mr. Geller: (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
s1/s1_e2.txt:103:Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
s1/s1_e2.txt:107:Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
s1/s1_e2.txt:115:Monica: What's that supposed to mean?
s1/s1_e2.txt:123:Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
s1/s1_e2.txt:129:Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?
s1/s1_e2.txt:134:Rachel: You're twins?
s1/s1_e2.txt:136:Chandler: What does she do?
s1/s1_e2.txt:143:Ross: ...How long was I in there?
s1/s1_e2.txt:145:Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
s1/s1_e2.txt:147:Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
s1/s1_e2.txt:152:Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
s1/s1_e2.txt:154:Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
s1/s1_e2.txt:156:Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together?
s1/s1_e2.txt:158:Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?
s1/s1_e2.txt:167:Ross: How could I forget?

s1/s1_e20.txt:16:Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
s1/s1_e20.txt:21:Joey: Her answer machine?
s1/s1_e20.txt:23:Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
s1/s1_e20.txt:26:Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
s1/s1_e20.txt:28:Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
s1/s1_e20.txt:35:Monica: How'd it go?
s1/s1_e20.txt:39:Ross: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
s1/s1_e20.txt:42:Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
s1/s1_e20.txt:43:Joey: Duh, where've you been?
s1/s1_e20.txt:44:Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
s1/s1_e20.txt:47:Rachel: Why?
s1/s1_e20.txt:49:Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
s1/s1_e20.txt:61:Ross: What was with the dishes?
s1/s1_e20.txt:67:Monica: What kinda stuff?

s1/s1_e20.txt:97:Chandler: Can I use your phone?
s1/s1_e20.txt:100:Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
s1/s1_e20.txt:104:Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?

s1/s1_e20.txt:120:Ross: You-you had what?
s1/s1_e20.txt:122:Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?
s1/s1_e20.txt:125:Rachel: Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
s1/s1_e20.txt:129:Phoebe: Where are you going?
s1/s1_e20.txt:130:Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
s1/s1_e20.txt:132:Chandler: Hello? Hello?

s1/s1_e20.txt:158:Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
s1/s1_e20.txt:159:Monica: Why don't you just call her?
s1/s1_e20.txt:161:Monica: Do you?
s1/s1_e20.txt:163:Monica: Don't you have to pee?
s1/s1_e20.txt:168:Rachel: Hey, you.... So, what's up?
s1/s1_e20.txt:173:Mindy: Will you be my maid of honour?
s1/s1_e20.txt:176:Rachel: Was that all you wanted to ask me?
s1/s1_e20.txt:178:Rachel: Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
s1/s1_e20.txt:182:Rachel: Um, what- what would make you think that?
s1/s1_e20.txt:186:Rachel: What? What's what you were afraid of?
s1/s1_e20.txt:188:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e20.txt:191:Mindy: What do you mean?
s1/s1_e20.txt:192:Rachel: (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
s1/s1_e20.txt:202:Joey: (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?

s1/s1_e20.txt:231:Rachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
s1/s1_e20.txt:233:Rachel: Even when we were having sex in that chair?
s1/s1_e20.txt:236:Mindy: (to Rachel) You did it twice?
s1/s1_e20.txt:248:Mindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
s1/s1_e20.txt:251:Monica: You okay?
s1/s1_e20.txt:253:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e20.txt:261:Phoebe: You know he's gay?
s1/s1_e20.txt:262:Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
s1/s1_e20.txt:263:Danielle: (entering) Chandler?
s1/s1_e20.txt:266:Chandler: What are you doing here?
s1/s1_e20.txt:269:Danielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
s1/s1_e20.txt:280:Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
s1/s1_e21.txt:4:Joey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
s1/s1_e21.txt:19:Ross: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:25:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:32:Monica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
s1/s1_e21.txt:36:Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?
s1/s1_e21.txt:38:Chandler: Joey... Switzerland?
s1/s1_e21.txt:41:Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
s1/s1_e21.txt:53:Phoebe: What are you doing?
s1/s1_e21.txt:55:Rachel: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
s1/s1_e21.txt:60:Monica: What d'you think?
s1/s1_e21.txt:63:Rachel: Which one do you think she is?
s1/s1_e21.txt:65:Teacher: May I help you?
s1/s1_e21.txt:68:Rachel: What does she mean?
s1/s1_e21.txt:70:Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
s1/s1_e21.txt:78:Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
s1/s1_e21.txt:89:Woman: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
s1/s1_e21.txt:93:Woman: (Fake Monica) Monana?
s1/s1_e21.txt:101:Joey: Where've you been?
s1/s1_e21.txt:103:Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
s1/s1_e21.txt:107:Chandler: So what does this mean?
s1/s1_e21.txt:112:Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
s1/s1_e21.txt:114:Joey: Isn't there any way you can keep him?
s1/s1_e21.txt:116:Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
s1/s1_e21.txt:122:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:123:Joey: Did you call the cops?
s1/s1_e21.txt:139:Monica: 'Scuse me?
s1/s1_e21.txt:140:Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
s1/s1_e21.txt:143:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:144:Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
s1/s1_e21.txt:146:Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
s1/s1_e21.txt:153:Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
s1/s1_e21.txt:155:Joey: (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
s1/s1_e21.txt:159:Joey: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
s1/s1_e21.txt:162:Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
s1/s1_e21.txt:163:Dr. Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
s1/s1_e21.txt:165:Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
s1/s1_e21.txt:167:Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?
s1/s1_e21.txt:168:Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?
s1/s1_e21.txt:169:Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
s1/s1_e21.txt:171:Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
s1/s1_e21.txt:172:Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
s1/s1_e21.txt:182:Rachel: Where the hell've you been?
s1/s1_e21.txt:190:Rachel: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
s1/s1_e21.txt:197:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:202:Monica: How are you?
s1/s1_e21.txt:203:Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
s1/s1_e21.txt:210:Monica: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
s1/s1_e21.txt:211:Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
s1/s1_e21.txt:217:Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?
s1/s1_e21.txt:219:Teacher: You by the door. In or out?
s1/s1_e21.txt:244:Casting Director No. 2: Name?
s1/s1_e22.txt:9:Chandler: Tell me what?
s1/s1_e22.txt:16:Ross: Why, why, why would you dream that?
s1/s1_e22.txt:17:Chandler: More importantly, was I any good?
s1/s1_e22.txt:23:Chandler: You're okay there?
s1/s1_e22.txt:30:Phoebe: (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
s1/s1_e22.txt:31:Joey: I don't know. What are you wearing?
s1/s1_e22.txt:33:Ross: Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
s1/s1_e22.txt:35:Chandler: Pirates again?
s1/s1_e22.txt:39:Phoebe: What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
s1/s1_e22.txt:45:Rachel: What are you playing with?
s1/s1_e22.txt:47:Joey: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
s1/s1_e22.txt:52:Rachel: Off to see young Ethan?
s1/s1_e22.txt:54:Joey: How young is young Ethan? Young?

s1/s1_e22.txt:58:Ross: College?
s1/s1_e22.txt:59:Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
s1/s1_e22.txt:61:All: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:62:Monica: Oh, I can't pass for 22?
s1/s1_e22.txt:67:Chandler: Can you hear that?
s1/s1_e22.txt:68:Phoebe: (plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
s1/s1_e22.txt:74:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:77:Phoebe: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
s1/s1_e22.txt:84:Chandler: (answering it) Yes?
s1/s1_e22.txt:85:Phoebe: Whatcha doin'?
s1/s1_e22.txt:88:Monica: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
s1/s1_e22.txt:90:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:91:Rachel: Could tonight be the Night?
s1/s1_e22.txt:93:Rachel: So, did you shave your legs?
s1/s1_e22.txt:106:Joey: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
s1/s1_e22.txt:110:Chandler: Why not?

s1/s1_e22.txt:156:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e22.txt:157:Young Ethan: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
s1/s1_e22.txt:173:Monica: You're not a senior?
s1/s1_e22.txt:180:Monica: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
s1/s1_e22.txt:182:Monica: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
s1/s1_e22.txt:186:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e22.txt:189:Young Ethan: Who?
s1/s1_e22.txt:194:Chandler: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
s1/s1_e22.txt:199:Ross: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
s1/s1_e22.txt:202:Joey: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
s1/s1_e22.txt:203:Rachel: (laughs) You know what?
s1/s1_e22.txt:204:Joey: What?

s1/s1_e22.txt:213:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:216:Ross: Are you not seeing him anymore?
s1/s1_e22.txt:221:Joey: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
s1/s1_e22.txt:224:Monica: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
s1/s1_e22.txt:231:Rachel: Where are you going?
s1/s1_e22.txt:237:Chandler: You think I should?
s1/s1_e22.txt:246:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:250:Chandler: They do?
s1/s1_e22.txt:259:Joey: What about Andr�?
s1/s1_e22.txt:264:Rachel: (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
s1/s1_e22.txt:267:Joey: They're here already?
s1/s1_e22.txt:271:Young Ethan: Then, what's the problem?
s1/s1_e22.txt:273:Young Ethan: Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
s1/s1_e22.txt:278:Ross: Are you're hands still wet?
s1/s1_e22.txt:290:Chandler: You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
s1/s1_e22.txt:296:Rachel: Ross?
s1/s1_e22.txt:300:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:302:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:303:Ross: I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
s1/s1_e22.txt:306:Rachel: Ross?
s1/s1_e23.txt:7:Monica: I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
s1/s1_e23.txt:10:Joey: Do we have to know about that?
s1/s1_e23.txt:11:Monica: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
s1/s1_e23.txt:17:Rachel: What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
s1/s1_e23.txt:20:Phoebe: Did I miss it, did I miss it?
s1/s1_e23.txt:22:Monica: What's with the guitar?
s1/s1_e23.txt:25:Ross: (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
s1/s1_e23.txt:39:Dr. Franzblau: Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
s1/s1_e23.txt:41:Dr. Franzblau: So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
s1/s1_e23.txt:46:Carol: Am I allowed to drink anything?
s1/s1_e23.txt:65:Lydia: Knick fan?
s1/s1_e23.txt:70:Joey: Oh yeah? And who do you like?
s1/s1_e23.txt:72:Joey: The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
s1/s1_e23.txt:94:Monica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
s1/s1_e23.txt:96:Monica: Oh yeah? When?
s1/s1_e23.txt:97:Chandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
s1/s1_e23.txt:98:Monica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s1/s1_e23.txt:100:Monica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s1/s1_e23.txt:102:Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
s1/s1_e23.txt:104:Monica: Well?
s1/s1_e23.txt:109:Monica: Did you go home and change?
s1/s1_e23.txt:110:Rachel: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
s1/s1_e23.txt:112:Rachel: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby needs him?
s1/s1_e23.txt:113:Chandler: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
s1/s1_e23.txt:114:Rachel: Yeah, why?
s1/s1_e23.txt:117:Lydia: Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean, Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?
s1/s1_e23.txt:120:Joey: (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?
s1/s1_e23.txt:122:Joey: Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
s1/s1_e23.txt:126:Joey: Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
s1/s1_e23.txt:145:Ross: Who the hell is Jordie?
s1/s1_e23.txt:156:Ross: Why?
s1/s1_e23.txt:173:Nurse: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
s1/s1_e23.txt:174:Joey: (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
s1/s1_e23.txt:178:Susan: How, how is this my fault?
s1/s1_e23.txt:181:Ross: You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
s1/s1_e23.txt:183:Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
s1/s1_e23.txt:190:Phoebe: Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
s1/s1_e23.txt:196:Carol: Are they here yet?
s1/s1_e23.txt:197:Rachel: No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
s1/s1_e23.txt:199:Rachel: Ok?
s1/s1_e23.txt:206:Susan: What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
s1/s1_e23.txt:213:Chandler: Where have you been?
s1/s1_e23.txt:217:Dr. Franzblau: I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
s1/s1_e23.txt:218:Rachel: (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
s1/s1_e23.txt:223:Dr. Franzblau: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
s1/s1_e23.txt:230:Lydia: So how did you know I was even here?
s1/s1_e23.txt:231:Guy: Your mom called me. So is this her?
s1/s1_e23.txt:234:Lydia: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey smiles) So, did you see who won the game?
s1/s1_e23.txt:241:Ross: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
s1/s1_e23.txt:245:Ross: You wanna explain that?
s1/s1_e23.txt:248:Carol: Where are they?
s1/s1_e23.txt:254:Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
s1/s1_e23.txt:265:Susan: What do you see?
s1/s1_e23.txt:274:Carol: (irked) Where have you been?
s1/s1_e23.txt:276:Dr. Franzblau: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need—(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have this?
s1/s1_e23.txt:280:Chandler: (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
s1/s1_e23.txt:283:Ross: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
s1/s1_e23.txt:287:Susan: What do you see? What do you see?
s1/s1_e23.txt:290:Carol: What does he look like?
s1/s1_e23.txt:292:Carol: Really?
s1/s1_e23.txt:298:Ross: (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
s1/s1_e23.txt:300:Carol: Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
s1/s1_e23.txt:306:Monica: Can we come in?
s1/s1_e23.txt:313:Monica: Ross, can I?
s1/s1_e23.txt:327:Joey: He doesn't do much, does he?
s1/s1_e23.txt:330:Rachel: You guys wanna get some coffee?
s1/s1_e24.txt:11:Rachel: Pardon?
s1/s1_e24.txt:19:Ross: (overhearing) What kind of research?
s1/s1_e24.txt:38:Phoebe: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
s1/s1_e24.txt:40:Monica: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
s1/s1_e24.txt:41:Joey: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
s1/s1_e24.txt:51:Phoebe: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
s1/s1_e24.txt:54:Monica: You're going to China?
s1/s1_e24.txt:57:Ross: (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
s1/s1_e24.txt:63:Ross: Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
s1/s1_e24.txt:76:Joey: The country?
s1/s1_e24.txt:77:Ross: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
s1/s1_e24.txt:80:Joey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
s1/s1_e24.txt:93:Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
s1/s1_e24.txt:96:Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
s1/s1_e24.txt:100:Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
s1/s1_e24.txt:101:Joey: What do you mean?
s1/s1_e24.txt:119:Rachel: Who's this from?
s1/s1_e24.txt:122:Phoebe: Remembered what?
s1/s1_e24.txt:127:Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
s1/s1_e24.txt:129:Rachel: What did you just say?
s1/s1_e24.txt:131:Rachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
s1/s1_e24.txt:142:Chandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
s1/s1_e24.txt:143:Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
s1/s1_e24.txt:144:Rachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
s1/s1_e24.txt:150:Chandler: What about the time difference?
s1/s1_e24.txt:151:Monica: From here to the airport?
s1/s1_e24.txt:153:Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
s1/s1_e24.txt:159:Phoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?
s1/s1_e24.txt:172:Flight Attendant: May I see your boarding pass?
s1/s1_e24.txt:178:Flight Attendant: Alright. What's the message?
s1/s1_e24.txt:182:Man: (confused) What?
s1/s1_e24.txt:190:Melanie: (surprised) M-Me again?
s1/s1_e24.txt:191:Joey: Sure! Why not?
s1/s1_e24.txt:195:Joey: How do you mean?
s1/s1_e24.txt:198:Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
s1/s1_e24.txt:206:Rachel: (confused) Huh?
s1/s1_e24.txt:207:Phoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
s1/s1_e24.txt:208:Monica: Why isn't it working out?
s1/s1_e24.txt:210:Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?
s1/s1_e24.txt:212:Monica: Does he not make enough money?
s1/s1_e24.txt:216:Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
s1/s1_e24.txt:218:Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
s1/s1_e24.txt:224:Chandler: So how'd it go?
s1/s1_e24.txt:225:Joey: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
s1/s1_e24.txt:233:Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
s1/s1_e24.txt:235:Monica: Oh, from who?
s1/s1_e24.txt:237:Monica: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
s1/s1_e24.txt:239:Monica: Oh, why?
s1/s1_e24.txt:245:Rachel: Who is it?
s1/s1_e24.txt:251:Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
s1/s1_e24.txt:253:Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
s1/s1_e24.txt:262:Ross: Can't do it, can you?
s1/s1_e24.txt:263:Rachel: So I'm thinking about you. So what?
s1/s1_e24.txt:264:Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
s1/s1_e24.txt:273:Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
s1/s1_e24.txt:274:Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
s1/s1_e24.txt:275:Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
s1/s1_e24.txt:282:Carl: Heh... y'know?
s1/s1_e24.txt:283:Rachel: You know what?
s1/s1_e24.txt:284:Carl: What?
s1/s1_e24.txt:297:Julie: Really?
s1/s1_e24.txt:299:Julie: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
s1/s1_e3.txt:6:Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
s1/s1_e3.txt:9:Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
s1/s1_e3.txt:11:Rachel: Since when?
s1/s1_e3.txt:15:Rachel: And everybody knows this?
s1/s1_e3.txt:32:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e3.txt:46:Joey: Y'miss it?
s1/s1_e3.txt:52:Ross: Can I use.. either thumb?
s1/s1_e3.txt:57:Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe?
s1/s1_e3.txt:59:Monica: What did they do to you?
s1/s1_e3.txt:72:Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?
s1/s1_e3.txt:73:Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
s1/s1_e3.txt:86:Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'?
s1/s1_e3.txt:88:Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy?
s1/s1_e3.txt:94:Rachel: Well, then can we meet him?
s1/s1_e3.txt:104:Monica: Do you all promise?
s1/s1_e3.txt:106:Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
s1/s1_e3.txt:113:Rachel: What bank is this?
s1/s1_e3.txt:115:Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
s1/s1_e3.txt:127:Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
s1/s1_e3.txt:132:Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
s1/s1_e3.txt:138:Ross: ...What shoe?
s1/s1_e3.txt:145:Ross: You know what I like most about him, though?
s1/s1_e3.txt:146:All: What?
s1/s1_e3.txt:151:Monica: Hi.. how was the game?
s1/s1_e3.txt:154:Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
s1/s1_e3.txt:160:Ross: What?
s1/s1_e3.txt:161:Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
s1/s1_e3.txt:169:Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?
s1/s1_e3.txt:171:Lizzie: Saltines?
s1/s1_e3.txt:172:Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
s1/s1_e3.txt:175:Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?
s1/s1_e3.txt:179:Lizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat?
s1/s1_e3.txt:182:Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
s1/s1_e3.txt:187:Lizzie: Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
s1/s1_e3.txt:197:Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
s1/s1_e3.txt:198:Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?
s1/s1_e3.txt:204:Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?
s1/s1_e3.txt:205:Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
s1/s1_e3.txt:207:Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
s1/s1_e3.txt:209:Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
s1/s1_e3.txt:212:Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?
s1/s1_e3.txt:220:Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
s1/s1_e3.txt:230:Joey: Do you have any respect for your body?
s1/s1_e3.txt:231:Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
s1/s1_e3.txt:242:Monica: (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
s1/s1_e3.txt:243:Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
s1/s1_e3.txt:248:Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
s1/s1_e3.txt:249:Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
s1/s1_e3.txt:254:Joey: (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
s1/s1_e3.txt:267:Ross: Is there somebody else?
s1/s1_e3.txt:270:Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
s1/s1_e3.txt:281:Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay?
s1/s1_e3.txt:288:Monica: Relieved?
s1/s1_e3.txt:296:Ross: So how'd it go?
s1/s1_e3.txt:298:Phoebe: Did he mention us?
s1/s1_e4.txt:4:Monica: Alright. Phoebe?
s1/s1_e4.txt:6:Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
s1/s1_e4.txt:10:Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
s1/s1_e4.txt:12:Monica: ..Excuse me?
s1/s1_e4.txt:18:Monica: How does she do that?
s1/s1_e4.txt:23:Monica: What's going on with you?
s1/s1_e4.txt:25:Ross: Why?
s1/s1_e4.txt:36:Joey: So?
s1/s1_e4.txt:37:Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
s1/s1_e4.txt:39:Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
s1/s1_e4.txt:42:Joey: What's wrong with the twentieth?
s1/s1_e4.txt:43:Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
s1/s1_e4.txt:46:Chandler: (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
s1/s1_e4.txt:47:Ross: What are you doing?
s1/s1_e4.txt:50:Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
s1/s1_e4.txt:55:Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine?
s1/s1_e4.txt:56:Phoebe: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
s1/s1_e4.txt:66:Leslie: (looking around) Rachel?
s1/s1_e4.txt:69:Rachel: What are you guys doing here?
s1/s1_e4.txt:74:Rachel: (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
s1/s1_e4.txt:84:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e4.txt:86:Chandler: Yes, Bunny?
s1/s1_e4.txt:88:Joey: -Peaches?
s1/s1_e4.txt:98:Joanne: When are you coming home?
s1/s1_e4.txt:102:Kiki: Waitressing?
s1/s1_e4.txt:107:Rachel: What's that?
s1/s1_e4.txt:117:Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
s1/s1_e4.txt:118:Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
s1/s1_e4.txt:122:Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
s1/s1_e4.txt:127:Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
s1/s1_e4.txt:129:Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs?
s1/s1_e4.txt:136:Phoebe: Floopy?
s1/s1_e4.txt:140:Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
s1/s1_e4.txt:141:Monica: ...Pheebs?
s1/s1_e4.txt:143:Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
s1/s1_e4.txt:161:Joey: Well, how long do you think it'll be?
s1/s1_e4.txt:169:Monica: Phoebe?
s1/s1_e4.txt:170:Phoebe: What?
s1/s1_e4.txt:171:Monica: Do you have a plan?
s1/s1_e4.txt:173:Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
s1/s1_e4.txt:178:Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
s1/s1_e4.txt:180:Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
s1/s1_e4.txt:181:Phoebe: And-and a power tie?
s1/s1_e4.txt:184:Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take this back?
s1/s1_e4.txt:186:Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
s1/s1_e4.txt:190:Rachel: Hello? Who are we spying on?
s1/s1_e4.txt:191:Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
s1/s1_e4.txt:201:Monica: Light still out?
s1/s1_e4.txt:206:Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like?
s1/s1_e4.txt:208:Phoebe: Yeah?
s1/s1_e4.txt:212:Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
s1/s1_e4.txt:215:Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
s1/s1_e4.txt:217:Chandler: Then what?
s1/s1_e4.txt:219:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e4.txt:225:Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
s1/s1_e4.txt:229:Monica: What?! You slept with Jason?
s1/s1_e4.txt:231:Rachel: How long?
s1/s1_e4.txt:240:Monica: Where?
s1/s1_e4.txt:246:Joey: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
s1/s1_e4.txt:248:Joey: Really?
s1/s1_e4.txt:254:Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
s1/s1_e4.txt:275:Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
s1/s1_e5.txt:6:Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
s1/s1_e5.txt:15:Joey: No plans, huh?
s1/s1_e5.txt:17:Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
s1/s1_e5.txt:25:Ross: Tony?
s1/s1_e5.txt:26:Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
s1/s1_e5.txt:28:Rachel: (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
s1/s1_e5.txt:30:Phoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
s1/s1_e5.txt:35:Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
s1/s1_e5.txt:43:Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?
s1/s1_e5.txt:50:Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
s1/s1_e5.txt:52:Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
s1/s1_e5.txt:53:Rachel: Who?
s1/s1_e5.txt:54:Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
s1/s1_e5.txt:55:Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
s1/s1_e5.txt:56:Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
s1/s1_e5.txt:60:Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
s1/s1_e5.txt:63:Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
s1/s1_e5.txt:64:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:66:Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
s1/s1_e5.txt:67:Angela: What four of us?
s1/s1_e5.txt:74:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:78:Joey: (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
s1/s1_e5.txt:81:Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
s1/s1_e5.txt:86:Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
s1/s1_e5.txt:87:Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
s1/s1_e5.txt:89:Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
s1/s1_e5.txt:93:Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
s1/s1_e5.txt:95:Monica: Which?
s1/s1_e5.txt:96:Joey: Which what?
s1/s1_e5.txt:97:Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?
s1/s1_e5.txt:104:Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?
s1/s1_e5.txt:113:Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
s1/s1_e5.txt:116:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:117:Janice: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:118:Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there?
s1/s1_e5.txt:124:Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
s1/s1_e5.txt:127:Chandler: That's it?
s1/s1_e5.txt:137:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:138:Woman: No suds, no save. Ok?
s1/s1_e5.txt:140:Ross: What's goin' on?
s1/s1_e5.txt:142:Ross: Was your basket on top?
s1/s1_e5.txt:144:Ross: So?
s1/s1_e5.txt:154:Rachel: What's that?
s1/s1_e5.txt:157:Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
s1/s1_e5.txt:158:Rachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
s1/s1_e5.txt:159:Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?
s1/s1_e5.txt:162:Rachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
s1/s1_e5.txt:165:Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
s1/s1_e5.txt:168:Monica: How, how did that happen?
s1/s1_e5.txt:170:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:173:Joey: So, you and Angela, huh?
s1/s1_e5.txt:182:Angela: Yeah, isn't he?
s1/s1_e5.txt:195:Rachel: What uh-oh?
s1/s1_e5.txt:197:Rachel: Ross, what's the matter?
s1/s1_e5.txt:206:Monica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
s1/s1_e5.txt:209:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:214:Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?
s1/s1_e5.txt:216:Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
s1/s1_e5.txt:222:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e5.txt:231:Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
s1/s1_e5.txt:235:Phoebe: Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?
s1/s1_e5.txt:236:Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?
s1/s1_e5.txt:244:Chandler: How do you do that?
s1/s1_e5.txt:262:Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
s1/s1_e5.txt:267:Rachel: Are you sure?
s1/s1_e5.txt:271:Rachel: Oh, are you sure you're ok?
s1/s1_e5.txt:273:Rachel: Does it still hurt?
s1/s1_e5.txt:278:Phoebe: Hey, how'd it go?
s1/s1_e5.txt:283:Rachel: Where's Chandler?
s1/s1_e6.txt:18:Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
s1/s1_e6.txt:22:Ross: What?
s1/s1_e6.txt:34:Chandler: Y'think?
s1/s1_e6.txt:39:Aurora: ...Yes?
s1/s1_e6.txt:43:Aurora: Chandler?
s1/s1_e6.txt:46:Joey: Whadja think?
s1/s1_e6.txt:52:Rachel: What is it?
s1/s1_e6.txt:60:Monica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
s1/s1_e6.txt:67:Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
s1/s1_e6.txt:69:Joey: Who's Rick?
s1/s1_e6.txt:70:Chandler: Who's Rick?
s1/s1_e6.txt:73:Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?
s1/s1_e6.txt:75:Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
s1/s1_e6.txt:77:Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
s1/s1_e6.txt:79:Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
s1/s1_e6.txt:82:Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
s1/s1_e6.txt:86:Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
s1/s1_e6.txt:87:Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
s1/s1_e6.txt:89:Phoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
s1/s1_e6.txt:91:Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
s1/s1_e6.txt:107:Rachel: Well, whaddya think?
s1/s1_e6.txt:111:Monica: How-how did that happen?
s1/s1_e6.txt:122:Monica: Why not?
s1/s1_e6.txt:128:Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
s1/s1_e6.txt:135:Monica: Well, what's the part?
s1/s1_e6.txt:137:Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?
s1/s1_e6.txt:139:Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
s1/s1_e6.txt:141:Rachel: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
s1/s1_e6.txt:147:Ross: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
s1/s1_e6.txt:153:Monica: For what?
s1/s1_e6.txt:163:Rachel: Who is being loud?
s1/s1_e6.txt:165:Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
s1/s1_e6.txt:167:Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
s1/s1_e6.txt:172:Director: (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?
s1/s1_e6.txt:175:Joey: Me?
s1/s1_e6.txt:180:Director: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
s1/s1_e6.txt:184:Director: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
s1/s1_e6.txt:201:Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
s1/s1_e6.txt:203:Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
s1/s1_e6.txt:206:Aurora: So what do you want?
s1/s1_e6.txt:210:Aurora: Whaddyou mean?
s1/s1_e6.txt:212:Aurora: ...Like, ...all of them?
s1/s1_e6.txt:213:Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
s1/s1_e6.txt:216:Aurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
s1/s1_e6.txt:218:Aurora: Which one?
s1/s1_e6.txt:225:Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
s1/s1_e6.txt:228:Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
s1/s1_e6.txt:230:Ross: No? What happened, big guy?
s1/s1_e6.txt:241:Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
s1/s1_e6.txt:248:Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
s1/s1_e6.txt:250:Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
s1/s1_e7.txt:15:Phoebe: Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
s1/s1_e7.txt:43:Monica: Hello?
s1/s1_e7.txt:45:Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
s1/s1_e7.txt:47:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e7.txt:51:Joey: What's up man?
s1/s1_e7.txt:61:Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
s1/s1_e7.txt:62:Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
s1/s1_e7.txt:64:Rachel: Um... Ross?
s1/s1_e7.txt:81:Ross: (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
s1/s1_e7.txt:90:Rachel: Really?
s1/s1_e7.txt:92:Rachel: You do?
s1/s1_e7.txt:97:Ross: (innocently) What?
s1/s1_e7.txt:99:Ross: (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
s1/s1_e7.txt:105:Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
s1/s1_e7.txt:108:Rachel: What are you shushing?
s1/s1_e7.txt:109:Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
s1/s1_e7.txt:111:Ross: See?
s1/s1_e7.txt:114:Jill: Would you like some gum?
s1/s1_e7.txt:115:Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?
s1/s1_e7.txt:121:Joey: Are you going to do it?
s1/s1_e7.txt:123:Joey: Do you want any help?
s1/s1_e7.txt:129:Joey: Hey, where are you going?
s1/s1_e7.txt:132:Monica: Why not?
s1/s1_e7.txt:134:Monica: And that would be?
s1/s1_e7.txt:136:Monica: Joey, what's going on?
s1/s1_e7.txt:138:Monica: About what?
s1/s1_e7.txt:142:Phoebe: About what?
s1/s1_e7.txt:144:Phoebe: What surprise party?
s1/s1_e7.txt:167:Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
s1/s1_e7.txt:169:Ross: (nonchalantly) Yeah?
s1/s1_e7.txt:173:Phoebe: (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
s1/s1_e7.txt:176:Phoebe: (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
s1/s1_e7.txt:178:Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?
s1/s1_e7.txt:180:Rachel: Bob Buttons?
s1/s1_e7.txt:201:Ross: (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
s1/s1_e7.txt:219:Jill: Are you alright?
s1/s1_e7.txt:221:Jill: My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?
s1/s1_e7.txt:223:Jill: Perfection?
s1/s1_e7.txt:228:Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
s1/s1_e7.txt:243:Paolo: Thing?
s1/s1_e7.txt:245:Paolo: Ah, you... have the sex?
s1/s1_e7.txt:247:Paolo: Bed?
s1/s1_e7.txt:250:Ross: Yeah! Se vice?
s1/s1_e7.txt:254:Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?
s1/s1_e8.txt:6:Shelley: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
s1/s1_e8.txt:7:Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
s1/s1_e8.txt:10:Shelley: Do you want a date Saturday?
s1/s1_e8.txt:13:Chandler: He's a he?
s1/s1_e8.txt:17:Chandler: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
s1/s1_e8.txt:19:Chandler: You did?
s1/s1_e8.txt:21:Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:26:Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
s1/s1_e8.txt:29:Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:31:Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
s1/s1_e8.txt:44:Ross: So, uh, how's she doing?
s1/s1_e8.txt:46:Monica: How-how are you, Mom?
s1/s1_e8.txt:47:Mrs. Geller: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
s1/s1_e8.txt:48:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e8.txt:49:Mrs. Geller: What's different?
s1/s1_e8.txt:62:Nurse: Mrs. Geller?
s1/s1_e8.txt:74:Mrs. Geller: What?
s1/s1_e8.txt:76:Aunt Lillian: (reentering) What's going on?
s1/s1_e8.txt:78:Aunt Lillian: She may have died?
s1/s1_e8.txt:86:Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
s1/s1_e8.txt:92:Joey: Twice?
s1/s1_e8.txt:94:Joey: You guys okay?
s1/s1_e8.txt:103:Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
s1/s1_e8.txt:109:Mrs. Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
s1/s1_e8.txt:117:Monica: You what?
s1/s1_e8.txt:130:Chandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:134:Chandler: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
s1/s1_e8.txt:137:Shelley: Is Brian...?
s1/s1_e8.txt:142:Ross: (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
s1/s1_e8.txt:152:Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
s1/s1_e8.txt:153:Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
s1/s1_e8.txt:156:Mrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
s1/s1_e8.txt:160:Mrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
s1/s1_e8.txt:165:Ross: (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
s1/s1_e8.txt:166:Monica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
s1/s1_e8.txt:169:Rachel: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
s1/s1_e8.txt:170:Phoebe: What'd I say?
s1/s1_e8.txt:172:Monica: Are these the shoes?
s1/s1_e8.txt:174:Ross: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
s1/s1_e8.txt:175:Joey: (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
s1/s1_e8.txt:176:Chandler: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
s1/s1_e8.txt:182:Joey: What?
s1/s1_e8.txt:185:Chandler: You're watching a football game at a funeral?
s1/s1_e8.txt:197:Ross: What, what is it?
s1/s1_e8.txt:207:Phoebe: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
s1/s1_e8.txt:209:Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
s1/s1_e8.txt:217:Rachel: (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
s1/s1_e8.txt:222:Mr. Geller: Whaddya got there?
s1/s1_e8.txt:224:Mr. Geller: What's the score?
s1/s1_e8.txt:228:Rachel: (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
s1/s1_e8.txt:233:Mrs. Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
s1/s1_e8.txt:236:Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
s1/s1_e8.txt:237:Mrs. Geller: Tell her what?
s1/s1_e8.txt:240:Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
s1/s1_e8.txt:243:Mrs. Geller: More wine, dear?
s1/s1_e8.txt:251:Rachel: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
s1/s1_e8.txt:254:Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
s1/s1_e8.txt:255:Chandler: Who are those people?
s1/s1_e8.txt:258:Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
s1/s1_e8.txt:259:Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
s1/s1_e8.txt:267:Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
s1/s1_e8.txt:268:Lowell: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
s1/s1_e8.txt:273:Chandler: So- you can tell?
s1/s1_e8.txt:275:Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
s1/s1_e8.txt:277:Chandler: He is?
s1/s1_e9.txt:5:Rachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
s1/s1_e9.txt:6:Terry: An advance?
s1/s1_e9.txt:11:Rachel: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
s1/s1_e9.txt:12:Guy: Huh?
s1/s1_e9.txt:15:Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
s1/s1_e9.txt:27:Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
s1/s1_e9.txt:30:Phoebe: What were you modeling for?
s1/s1_e9.txt:31:Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
s1/s1_e9.txt:32:Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
s1/s1_e9.txt:34:Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
s1/s1_e9.txt:41:Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
s1/s1_e9.txt:42:Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
s1/s1_e9.txt:46:Monica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
s1/s1_e9.txt:49:Phoebe: Yeah. Oh, can I come?
s1/s1_e9.txt:50:Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
s1/s1_e9.txt:55:Phoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
s1/s1_e9.txt:58:Ross: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
s1/s1_e9.txt:62:Susan: What's it look like?
s1/s1_e9.txt:69:Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
s1/s1_e9.txt:70:Susan: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
s1/s1_e9.txt:71:Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
s1/s1_e9.txt:73:Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
s1/s1_e9.txt:75:Ross: Really?
s1/s1_e9.txt:82:Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
s1/s1_e9.txt:88:Monica: (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
s1/s1_e9.txt:92:Joey: (to Monica) We did?
s1/s1_e9.txt:96:Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
s1/s1_e9.txt:104:Girl: We did?
s1/s1_e9.txt:105:Joey: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
s1/s1_e9.txt:111:Joey: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
s1/s1_e9.txt:113:Joey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
s1/s1_e9.txt:115:Joey: What's wrong?
s1/s1_e9.txt:117:Joey: Oh. What?
s1/s1_e9.txt:123:Rachel: Saw what?
s1/s1_e9.txt:129:Monica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
s1/s1_e9.txt:137:Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?
s1/s1_e9.txt:155:Monica: Why would we do that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:161:Joey: The balloon?
s1/s1_e9.txt:162:Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
s1/s1_e9.txt:164:Chandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
s1/s1_e9.txt:179:Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
s1/s1_e9.txt:185:Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
s1/s1_e9.txt:197:Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
s1/s1_e9.txt:199:Susan: Hi, how's it goin?
s1/s1_e9.txt:200:Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:202:Ross: Does it always, uh--?
s1/s1_e9.txt:210:Monica: Can you go any faster with that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:212:Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
s1/s1_e9.txt:219:Monica: Why would I have the keys?
s1/s1_e9.txt:220:Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
s1/s1_e9.txt:223:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e9.txt:225:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e9.txt:236:Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
s1/s1_e9.txt:237:Joey: You call that delicious?
s1/s1_e9.txt:243:Rachel: What?
s1/s1_e9.txt:250:Chandler: Shall I carve?
s1/s1_e9.txt:252:Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
s1/s1_e9.txt:254:Monica: (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
s1/s1_e9.txt:257:Monica: Make a wish?
s1/s1_e9.txt:258:Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
s1/s1_e9.txt:268:Hemorrhoids?
