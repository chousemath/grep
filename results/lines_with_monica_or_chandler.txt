s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: That's right.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Cookie?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: No you don't.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Rachel?!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Yes!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (horrified) Really?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: I have no idea.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: All finished!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Oh, God.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Oh my God!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Oh my God!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: -leg?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: That is amazing.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Stop!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: We'll talk later.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Big time!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: What for?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: How do you do that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: You know Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: How'd you pay for them?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: And who pays for that?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: All right, you ready?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: You can, I know you can!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: You be okay?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: What? I-I said you had a-
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Monica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
s1/s1_e1.txt:Chandler: Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: W-wait. What is that?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: No, no, I don't.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: So, how'd it go?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: So what are you gonna be?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: I think it's romantic.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: What?!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Yeah.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: What's the matter?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: You remember Janice.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Vividly.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: That thing is not coming in here.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: (Imitating) But you found me!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
s1/s1_e10.txt:Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?
s1/s1_e10.txt:Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: We are not going to whistle.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I wish all guys could be like him.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: He doesn't have anyone.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Last night.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: ...And then he burst into flames.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Nah... not-not special enough.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Waaay too special.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: I know I am.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Yeah.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: ...What did I ask?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: What are you doing here?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Oh my God.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: (To Joey) You knew about this?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Hey.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Hello.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: No, you?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: You just asked me.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: What was that?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Oh! You're awake!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: You look good!
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Oh, sorry.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I got you the foot massager.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: I read to you.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Oh, my pleasure.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: "See you around?"
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Really stupid.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yeah. No. No...
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yeah, okay.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Nice save.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Hey.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.
s1/s1_e11.txt:Monica: What's a 'niffle'?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: No-no-no-no, we're done.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: You think?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: I'm not moving out.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Aw, don't do that
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: And Monica knows...
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Phoebe, what is it?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: More coffee over here, please!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Well, what happened?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Are you sure?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Was it...?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Oh!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: So what are you gonna do?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: That's patio furniture!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: You pick one.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: So, what do you think?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: I know!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Oh, you're right.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Wha-
s1/s1_e12.txt:Joey and Chandler: What is it?
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! (they hug)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms.)
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: Yeah, get out!
s1/s1_e12.txt:Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
s1/s1_e12.txt:Chandler: (to Joey) One more game?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: I'm sorry!
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Rachel, wait, wait.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Can I just say one thing?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Okay.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Huh.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Hello?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: C'mon up.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: You're welcome.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Well, you're gonna.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Yeah. I really do.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Get off!
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Hi...May I help you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Okay...who are you?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Oh, c'mon in.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: (Comes out of his room) What? What?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: How's it going?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Basically we just feel that he's...
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: So you talked to your dad, huh.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: How's it going?
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
s1/s1_e13.txt:Monica: Hello, Joey.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Any contact?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: I think it's winning.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: You can not do this.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: ...And what did you bring?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Janice?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: There's more beer, right?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Burning's good.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: That's OK.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Tell me it's "you and me" we.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: I hope she throws up on you.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: So...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Oh, Chandler, sorry.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Ok, well, this was very special.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Janice is gonna go away now.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: I'll be right back.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, good, Joey's home now.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Can we just start throwing things in?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: No.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Hi, Just Janice.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: (surprised) It is?
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Oh, no I don't.
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: I did, but...
s1/s1_e14.txt:Chandler: Call me!
s1/s1_e14.txt:Monica: They're nice guys.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: So.... I quit.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (excited) Oh my God!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Who are you going out with?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: (smiling)....with??
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Again?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Well?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: Last time I do that, I promise.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Ten dollars an hour.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Twelve dollars an hour.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Hi Steve!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (to Steve) This is Rachel.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: I'm so glad you liked them!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: No, we don't. (reaches for box)
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Give them to me.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: No, give me the...
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
s1/s1_e15.txt:Monica: I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
s1/s1_e15.txt:Chandler: (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: It’s Phoebe! Hi!
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Can we start over?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: They’re twins!
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Let’s not do that any more.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Your sister Ursula.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Ross, that’s my jacket.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Great.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Hey, where you been?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Score.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: And?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: So what does this mean?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Rachel and Chandler: Hey.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: I’ll get it.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Sure, why not?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Are you alright?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Chandler: You’re not gonna lose him.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
s1/s1_e16.txt:Monica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Well there's not much we can do.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh).
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: What are you crazy? That's a baby!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Well, only if you order stuff.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: There it is! So what're you gonna do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: And your friend Phoebe?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Uh, you left out the stupid part.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Alright, what have we learned so far?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Come on, she'll be here any minute.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Oh...
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: (Reading) "Happy Birthday Peehe."
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Did you see Betty?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Hi, come on in.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Hi, Geoffrey.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: It's uh...
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: What!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (getting angry) What!!?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Ross, he's got the remote again.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Rachel and Monica: Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Thank you.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Yes.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Ross and Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: You know, you think I would.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: What's up with the simian?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: What's goin' on?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Rachel and Monica: Oh, thank you.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Michael.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Monica.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: (as Rachel) Hi.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Oh, look, he's waking up!
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: �A qui�n pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's chicken?)
s1/s1_e17.txt:Chandler: �Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
s1/s1_e17.txt:Monica: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got the remote.)
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Hey, guys.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Lots of responses.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: (reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes up letter)
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: ...little playthings with yarn?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Could you want her more?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: We're not—we're not saying anything.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: And then he did.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: I mean, that's a typical guy response.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Hell no, we'll pay!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: And you know what? We want a rematch.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: You're kidding! Where? Where?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Oh, Rachel!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Well, what's the job?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: I don't think so.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Excuse me, where are you going?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Me too.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: (slams down cards) I hate this game!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Y'know, I've had dates like this.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Sorry, Rach.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Alright, check.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Call.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: Rachel, there's nothing in it.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: OK, here you go. Good luck.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Good luck.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Chandler: Go.
s1/s1_e18.txt:Monica: That, you get? That, you get?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: What is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Barry who you almost...?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: And Mindy, your maid of...?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Wonderful!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Toootal chick-flick.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: There was nudity!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: They're still just friends, right?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Which ones?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Rachel lost Marcel.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: He- he pooped in my shoe.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: No!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: The Luisa from home room!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: No, none at all.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Yes have you seen any?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Marcel?!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Marcel?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Whaaat!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: What is it?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Look, Phoebe!
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: What're you gonna do?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Oh gosh.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: That's because I'm in front of them.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Eh. I thought that was an alp.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
s1/s1_e19.txt:Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Absolutely.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: ...Dinah?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: You didn't.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Boys? We're going in.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Curry.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: What's that supposed to mean?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: No it's not.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: What does she do?
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: No.
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: Am not!
s1/s1_e2.txt:Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I feel violated. And not in a good way.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: So have you called her yet?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Hey Rach!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: How'd it go?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Yes!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I have my reasons.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Great, now he's waving back.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: What kinda stuff?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Can I use your phone?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: She answered.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Uh huh.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Hello? Hello?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: So how's Mindy?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Brrrrrrr!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Hell is filled with people like you.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: ...And boogie!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Why don't you just call her?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Do you?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Don't you have to pee?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: 'S'why I'm dancing...
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Ring dammit, ring!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: What?!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Nngghhh!!!!!!!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: So she's a woman! So what?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Joey!!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: The green dress? Really?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: You okay?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Aww... (They hug)
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: What are you doing here?
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: ...I'm, I'm okay.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Okay.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Monica: Yeah, there you go!
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: ...I dunno.
s1/s1_e20.txt:Chandler: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: I know. It's just such reckless spending.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: That's me.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey...
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: This woman's living my life.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Joey... Switzerland?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Might wanna try Joseph.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: What d'you think?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Okay, I'm not getting this!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Great. It's gym class all over again.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Yeah. It's Dutch.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: So what does this mean?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: ...Take off their hats!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Monana was very brave.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: 'Scuse me?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Uh-huh.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: You're kidding.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: ...He's in.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Yo- hooo!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Water rules!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: They've arrested Monica.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Hey.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: How are you?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: That I was not expecting.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Oh. Thanks.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Not necessarily...
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Um, I'm not actually Amish.
s1/s1_e21.txt:Fake Monica: Really? Then why are you like that?
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
s1/s1_e21.txt:Monica: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
s1/s1_e21.txt:Chandler: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Tell him.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Just...please tell him.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Tell me what?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Look at you, you won't even look at him.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Wow!
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: More importantly, was I any good?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: You're okay there?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Hello Rachel.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Pirates again?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Thank you.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: He's... our age.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: When we were?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Okay, he's a senior in college.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Oh, I can't pass for 22?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: I am 26.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Can you hear that?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Ah!
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Okay.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Bye bye.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: (answering it) Yes?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Ooh. (leans against the desk)
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Yeah.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Why not?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: What?!
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: What are you talking about?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I can't belive it.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: They do me?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I don't sound like that.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Did not.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: How was that possible?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Okay.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Unless...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Ethan?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Are you a virgin?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: You keep saying that.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: You're not a senior?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Ok...ay.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Oh.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Tyrannosaurus!
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Work people? Nobody told me.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: You think I should?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Okay.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Okay.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Then, I don't get it.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: They do?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: I just wan't to...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: But I just wa...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Aren't you gonna...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: That was gonna be my opener.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: It was.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: ...love you.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Yeah, like in a cab...
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Okay, hating this.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Monica: I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
s1/s1_e22.txt:Chandler: Here we go, here we go.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: You have to pick your moments.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: What's with the guitar?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: I used to have that bumper sticker.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: (to Rachel) You see what I mean.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: I want a baby.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: You'll get one.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Oh yeah? When?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: No, no, no.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: (trapped) Uh, uh.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Well?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Did you go home and change?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: No, I haven't seen him.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance? (Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Where have you been?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Mazel tov!
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: (to Joey) You are really frightening me.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Can we come in?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: I know, I still am one of these.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: Ross, can I?
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
s1/s1_e23.txt:Chandler: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
s1/s1_e23.txt:Monica: He is so amazing.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (in a deep voice) Men are here.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Man's got a point.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Crazy bitch.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Joey... we always know what you mean.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Hey.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: You're going to China?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Yeah.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Forget about her.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Course there, they just call it food.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Y'know, just be there for her.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Think about it.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: I can't believe he did this.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (quickly) H-He's in China!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: What about the time difference?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: From here to the airport?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Another good point.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Why isn't it working out?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Does he not make enough money?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Hey, big...
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: (quietly) ...spender.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: So how'd it go?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: I didn't know you had another level.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh, from who?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Oh, why?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Monica: Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
s1/s1_e24.txt:Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Uh, Ross.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Hey, that was really good!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: "Smoke away."
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Relax your hand!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Not so much!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Hey!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: What did they do to you?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: We're with you. We got it.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: And this- is my reward!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Nope. Schhorry.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Do you all promise?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: C'mon!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Really!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Hi.. how was the game?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (turns off the TV) Okay..
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Alright, we have to talk.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending-
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I'm sorry..
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (dubious) I understand.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: I'm, I'm really sorry.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Relieved?
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: (entering) Hi.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: Oh, y'know..
s1/s1_e3.txt:Monica: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
s1/s1_e3.txt:Chandler: (returns) Yeah, alright.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Alright. Phoebe?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: ..Excuse me?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: How does she do that?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: What's going on with you?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: You got waaaay too much free time.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Happy birthday, pal!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (stops) I have no idea.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: You got it.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Yeah, yeah.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Yes, Bunny?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and-
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Ah, the other Jack.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: ...Pheebs?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: He's open!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Phoebe?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Do you have a plan?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: (staggered) Oh God.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: I see pizza!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Please tell me it's his mother.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Oh, no...
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Light still out?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: I think he's shy.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Then what?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: What?! You slept with Jason?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Oh, that's nice!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Excuse me?!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Where?
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: You gotta do it, man.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Monica: Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
s1/s1_e4.txt:Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Not a one.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Yuh-huh.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: There you go.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Which?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Here we go.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Hey, Janice.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: (covering) What... did you get me there?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: That's great.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: That's it?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: How, how did that happen?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Oh my god.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: (hits him lightly) Oh!
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: (leaving) I'm outta here.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Really?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: Oh, I don't know, a million?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: I'm fine.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: I'm not fine. Here she comes.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: How do you do that?
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: We should always always break up together.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: Hi.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Monica: (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
s1/s1_e5.txt:Chandler: I'm free! I'm free!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: No, ten o'clock.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Thank you, buddy.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: You could do that!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Y'think?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Hey, kids.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Who's Rick?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: ...Hm.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Good for you, Joey.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: How-how did that happen?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: That is so unfair!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Why not?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: I could do that.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Well, what's the part?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Alright, alright, alright...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: For what?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: I warned you...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: God, I love these fingers...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Don't go.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: You.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Nono, just you.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Lose the other guys.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: ...The second guy.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: (to Ross) "Big guy?"
s1/s1_e6.txt:Chandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: (determined) Uh-huh!
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)
s1/s1_e6.txt:Monica: (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Oh, great. This is just...
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: There you go!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: You're definitely scaring here.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Hello?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Hey, it's me.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: I have no idea what you just said.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: You did not go!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Outside.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Why not?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: And that would be?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Joey, what's going on?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: About what?
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Oh my God! I love him!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: My surprise party!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: (smitten) Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: Hi!
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
s1/s1_e7.txt:Monica: If you want, I'll do it.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: OK.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
s1/s1_e7.txt:Chandler: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Yes please.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: He's a he?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: You did?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: I did.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: How-how are you, Mom?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: What?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Nothing.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is...
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Oh God!
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: I know.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Ross!
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: We checked. A lot.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Dad!
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: You what?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Define fun.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: That's probably what they'll say.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Hey, gorgeous.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: ...Quality, right, great.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Are these the shoes?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: It was a really beautiful service.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: You're watching a football game at a funeral?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Oh, no-
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Hey.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: That sounds like Nana.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: ...I can imagine.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Huh.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Oh, I think so.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Thank you. They're yours.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Who are those people?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Hey, Lowell.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Really.
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: So- you can tell?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: He is?
s1/s1_e8.txt:Chandler: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: I am not wrong.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: No, I just talked to them.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Hey.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Yes, every single one of them.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: So you're free Thursday, then.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: I thought it was $98.50.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Rach, here's your mail.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (insistently) No, here's your mail.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: We all chipped in.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: That's not a question.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Ah!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why would we do that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: No I don't.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (panicked) The oven is on.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Well then get it, get it!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (angry) Joey!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Can you go any faster with that?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: I swear you said you had the keys.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why would I have the keys?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: But I didn't.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Shall I carve?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Monica: Make a wish?
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
s1/s1_e9.txt:Chandler: Here, here!
